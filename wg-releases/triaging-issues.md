# Electron Issues Triage

Triaging issues in Electron allows maintainers to more quickly parse context and determine if a given issue is an issue that should be prioritized. It also allows for more effectively determining who has requisite context to solve a given issue.

Issue triage is not an exact science, but the following general rules are helpful to keep in mind when working to triage.

## Check Basics

**Is this an issue at all?**

If the issue is a question about a module in Electron or a request to help an opener solve a bug in their own code, the issue tracker is not currently the appropriate forum for this. As such, issues of this nature should be closed:

> Thanks for reaching out!

> Because we treat our issues list as the team's backlog, we close issues that are questions since they don't represent a task needing to be completed. For most questions about Electron there are a lot of options. 

> Check out the [Electron community](https://github.com/electron/electron#community). There are also a bunch of helpful people in this [community forum](https://discuss.atom.io/c/electron) that should be willing to point you in the right direction.

**Has the issue opener ignored the template?**

If they have, that issue should be marked with the `blocked` label and more information should be requested. The following provides a typical response we may give in that case, but you may adapt it to your needs:

> We require the template to be filled out on all new issues and pull requests. We do this so that we can be certain we have all the information we need to address your submission efficiently. This allows the maintainers to spend more time fixing bugs, implementing enhancements, and reviewing and merging pull requests.

> We will be able to more closely look at your issue once you do so. This issue will be closed in 10 days if the above is not addressed.

If the opener has filled out the template but omitted key aspects of it, like the platform or Electron version, this is also the suitable template to use. You may also add a bit of extra information to it specifying what exactly they omitted from the template and why it is important.

**Apply Basic Labels** 

From the information provided in the template, important labels to add include:

For Bugs:
* Operating System (e.g. `platform/macOS`, `platform/windows`, `platform/linux`)
* Affected Release Line (e.g. `10-x-y`, `9-x-y`, etc)
* Bug Type (`bug`, `bug/crash`, `bug/regression`)

For Features
* The `enhancement` label
* Operating System (if applicable)

There are also a series of `component` labels touching different subsystems of Electron. If for example the opener is reporting a new bug or requesting a new feature for the `menu` module, it would also be appropriate to apply the `component/menu` label. Not all subsystems have labels - you may make new ones or omit the component at your discretion.

**Is the version still supported?**

If the version of Electron a bug is being reported if still a supported version per [current policy](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/support)? If not, it is appropriate to mark as `blocked` here as well, and request that the bug be tested on a supported version before it can be triaged. A reply that may be appropriate here is:

> The version of Electron you reported this on, [VERSION], has been superseded by newer releases -- the latest in that series is [NEWEST_VERSION]. In order for us to be able to triage this issue, it must be reproducible on a a supported release line. If it cannot be reproduced in a supported line, this issue will be closed

> I'm setting the more-information-needed label for the above reasons. After you've responded, please @ me in a followup comment. 

> Thanks in advance! Your help is appreciated.

## Check Reproducible Steps

As the issue triager, it is not your responsibility to confirm whether or not an issue is reproducible based on a provided sample unless you so choose. We just want to confirm that one has been provided. Ideally, the user will provide a Fiddle Gist link or a link to a repo we may clone down. 

Some reporters will provide a small snippet without context, and if you can, we would like to avoid that. If you do not think you could reasonable determine how to run an Electron instance from the provided sample, or there is no sample, it would be appropriate to request a more thorough repro:

> Please provide a standalone test that a tester could run to reproduce the issue. This makes fixing issues go more smoothly: not only does it ensure the right thing is tested, but it also prevents triage from bottlenecking on making testers write new tests for each new issue.

> I'm setting the more-information-needed label for the above reasons. After you've responded, please @ me in a followup comment.

> Thanks in advance! Your help is appreciated.
