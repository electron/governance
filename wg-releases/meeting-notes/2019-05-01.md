## Agenda
*Please add your agenda items here **with** the name of the person adding the item*
1. (**@codebytere**) Where should the [5.0.0 retro](https://hackmd.io/IcaP_GONTXq9J5XIlJVAQg) live?
    * Do we think it should be ephemeral (not put into version control) or potentially added to a new `retro` section of the Release WG dir inside the gov repo?
    * **Verdict:** PR into gov repo
2. (**@codebytere**) Should Electron invest in its own paid Heroku team?
    * **Verdict:** Yes, ask the Admin WG 
3. (**@sofianguy**) Let's talk release dates again
    * [#17923](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17923)
    * **Verdict:** done, no action needed
4. (**@marshallofsound**) Open floor for release process hardening, it should be 1-click and go so how can we make sudowoodo more resilient to failures in third party systems.
    i) Retry GH api requests in the release notes phase [#18085](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/18085)
    ii) Make the prepare-release Sudowoodo step retryable
