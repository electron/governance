## Agenda

* When `pending-vote` labels are voted on and approved, a new label should replace it to indicate that it's done.
    * This has been done.

* Backport exceptions for security lines
    * **Verdict:** No per policy, if these should go back a compelling case must be made by the requester.
    * https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/24160
    * https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/24161
    * https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/24162
    * https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/24164

* Adjust release notes to differentiate between PRs that have also been backported to older branch. Or have a separate section for new PRs.
    * This would be super helpful for an app developer doing Electron upgrades so they don't spend time looking into a PR that was actually BP'd already to an older version.

* [#24097](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/24097) - Context menu PR reland 
    * Need address of [this comment](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/24097#issuecomment-645528221)
