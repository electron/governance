## Agenda

* Can we update to node 12.13.0 LTS version in Electron 7 by creating a new minor/ Use 7.1.x ?
    * **Actions**: Deepak to talk to vscode about the needs around node versioning
* Dropping Linux 32 bit builds (ia32 and armv7)
    * **Actions**: John to look into splitting the static build for now.  Best effort only, too much time we remove it.
* Small update on MAS private APIs
    * Sam is talking to Apple
    * Some concern about the private APIs we need to remove
* Build perf
    * Looking for ideas on how to make our builds faster
* https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/20772
    * has historically been broken on every major version
    * **Action:** john to coordinate with wg-upgrades for either fixing this or replacing feature with Headless
* Remove debug builds
    * Slowest factor on CI
    * Causes issues with upgrades and code changes that don't actually affect release builds or testing builds (the two builds we actually care about on CI)
    * Testing is faster and actually represents what we test against on CI.  Local dev should be using those builds to run tests against
    * Removing will free up CI resources to be used elsewhere, in particular speeding up our non-goma builds
    * Folks can still adjust the symbol level or the is_component_build setting themselves locally for whatever reason
