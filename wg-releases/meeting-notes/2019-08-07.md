## Agenda

* Brainstorm solutions for Start Doing items from our [6.0.0 Retro](https://github.com/electron/governance/projects/5)
    1) Test on windows more on our own devices, 3/4 last minute PRs in the quiet period were for Windows OS only and current issues post-stable are for Windows as well. We should regularly do dev / general usage on Windows
        * Group effort for consciously using Windows
    3) Upgrade node more continuously, the 12.4 upgrade almost Got Us Badly
        * move to Upgrades WG
