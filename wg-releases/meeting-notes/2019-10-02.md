## Agenda
* https://github.com/electron/governance/pull/159, which merges docs-n-tools and website, needs consensus from existing the WGs in order to be ratified. Could this WG please review? (added by @ckerr)
    * PR approved
* Should we recruit more members for this WG?
    * Yes - make announcement [@jkleinsc]
* Should we increase number of releasers?
    * Yes
    * Documentation on release process [@sofianguy/@jkleinsc/@robo]
    * Sudowoodo releasers needs to be updated in constants.ts file

## Backport Requests
* BP for 7-0-x (needs manual) https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/19960
    * Factors: It's late in the cycle, Sam isn't here to advocate for it, and it's not clear that this is something that any of the AFP members need in a 7-0-x release. OTOH it's fairly simple code and is likely safe.
    * Agreement that this will _not_ go in 7-0-x
    * A WG member will follow up in the PR to see if this is needed in a future 7-x-y branch
