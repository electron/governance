## Agenda

* Discussion: does it make sense to make a 'deprecations' section in release notes? One resolution of the NYC summit was to make it easier to find what's changed in a release. Right now we have a section saying "we removed these deprecated features" but nothing saying "these are newly deprecated". OTOH maybe this just repeats information that's already available in the [breaking changes doc](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/breaking-changes.md)? (topic added by @ckerr)
    * Resolved to add deprecation information to major releases
* Add process for EOL'ing major versions
    * Promote EOL
    * Release final release for EOL version
    * Deprecate in NPM?
* Review release schedule for 8.0.0 https://github.com/electron/governance/pull/186
    * :+1:
* Vote on adding @zcbenz
    * Approved
