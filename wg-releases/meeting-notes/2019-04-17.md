## Agenda
*Please add your agenda items here **with** the name of the person adding the item*

1. (**@codebytere**) Messaging of bugfix priority and cadence
    * It's unclear to the community how we use our project boards and what it means for the status of their bugs
    * Clarify that project board doesn't mean active


2. (**@sofianguy**) 6.0.0 Release Timeline: proposed dates
    * Do we want to kick off 6.0.0-beta.1 a week after 5.0.0 release? 
    * Or do we want to kick off 6.0.0-beta.1 right after / day after 5.0.0 release? 
    * We can also discuss this in Vancouver next week
    * **Verdict:** Publish `6.0.0-beta.1` next Thursday, April 25

3. (**@sofianguy**) Future release timelines for beta.1 kickoffs -- do we want to start them right after / a day after a major release or a week after? 
    * **Verdict:** publish the first subsequent major beta a day after the stable has been published.
