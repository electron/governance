## Agenda

* ICU updates to older supported versions of Electron? (@ckerr)
* Which Node version are we going to target for E10?
    * Sticking with Node 12
* Do we want to publicize E11 as a quiet release? For the E9 blog post
    * **Verdict:** No, because we haven't done it before and aren't sure it will work :slightly_smiling_face:
* E9 highlighted feature items
    * Add suggestions in comments to this PR https://github.com/electron/electronjs.org/pull/3950/files
* Rolling Node.js minors in Electron minors
    * ABI stability (how does Node guarantee this? Can we emulate?)
* @VerteDinde membership vote
    * **Verdict:** Approved
