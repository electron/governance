## 8.0.0 retro
* On-time stable release
* Thoughts on last minute approvals for adding two minor feats 
    * https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/21990
    * https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/21895
    * It seems last few releases had last minute feature requests
    * We feel like we are breaking our own rules regarding release policies, i.e., release quiet period.
    * A few downstream apps report that more frequent releases do not affect their upgrade process, i.e., patch or minor releases
    * We could consider pushing up the stable release and then releasing a minor right after
    * We shouldn't be afraid of minors, especially with our new branch system
    * General group agreement on keeping our group's integrity for preset release policies and dates
    * There were no reports of negative feedback for adding the two last minute feature BPs

## 9.0.0-beta.1 retro
