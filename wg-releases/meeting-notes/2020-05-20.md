    * outcome action items:
        1. Add a stable prep check list item to kick off final release of the last supported major version before it becomes EOL. Also add a deprecation/EOL notice in the release notes of that release.
        2. (@codebytere) Make and require labels for all PRs, specificially to identify breaking changes PRs. 
            * e.g., semver/minor label
        4. Keep blog post and release notes as separate resources
        5. Make sure release notes are ready when we kick off stable release. Blog post will still be published on the release date/when chromium releases
        6. Eliminate quiet week but keep target dates as goals to ensure we don't lose sight of landing changes on time
