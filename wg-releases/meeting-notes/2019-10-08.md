## Agenda
* Further discussion on merging 7-0-x https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/19960
    * After further discussion, due to pressing timing requirements from an AFP member and the limited impact we deemed the PR to have, it was decided to include this feature in 7-0-x.
    * We will release this in `7.0.0-beta.6` release. Target release kick off: today.
