## Agenda
* Stable prep item check in
* (Keeley) Spectron: Call for Maintainers
  * Spectron is fairly unmaintained, similar to Devtron - could I add a pinned issue call for maintainer help, so interested parties might contribute?
* (Sofia) Sweep of old issues?
  * Agreed, will move forward
* (Keeley) Vote for merge rights (Releases & Upgrades need to approve)
  * Verdict: Approved
