## Agenda

* Nightly uptime - when nightlies die, what should we try to do about it?
  * We should improve the cleanup script
    * It should work even if sudowoodo has restarted / died in the middle
  * Documentation for undoing a nightly needs to be improved
    * “Our documentation is bad and it should be less bad” :D Less bad plz
  * Sam will make a notification system for when nightlies have failed 3 days in a row.
    * Perhaps GitHub Action?
* OpenJS promoting Electron 11 release
  * Rachel needs rough draft by Nov. 2 (two weeks prior to release)
  * @VerteDinde can own, but if we want anything specific in, let me know
* Undocumented Windows API use?
* `11-x-y` updates https://github.com/electron/electron/projects/26
* New member vote: Michaela
  * **Verdict:** Approved
