## Agenda

1. (**@MarshallOfSound**) Affinity?
    * This is a feature that was implemented a while ago that allows multiple browser windows
    * We would like to know if any large apps use affinity mode
        * TODO: Sofia to ask AFP members
    * If an app is using it still, maybe they can patch it on their own
    * Affinity removal is related to Sam's work on NAPI (https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/18397)
    * We do not want to support a process model that chromium doesn't support; chromium is constantly changing how that works and it's a pain for us to upkeep
    * Postponing discussion to next week after Sofia surveys AFP apps about their affinity mode usage
2. (**@jkleinsc**) Moving releases over to AppVeyor cloud
    * Two PRs need review:
        *  https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/18337
        *  https://github.com/electron/sudowoodo/pull/120
