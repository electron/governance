## Agenda

1. Auditing outstanding PRs before every release kick
  * [#26528](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/26528) was missed very close to `11.0.1` release 
  * Conclusion: group to announce a release is going at X time in #wg-releases, but group understanding that sometimes this announcement won’t have long heads up beforehand.
2. Check in about `11.0.0` and `12.0.0-beta.1`
3. Chair rotation
  * @VerteDinde selected as next chair! 

## Backport Requests

1. [#26549](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/26549) 
* Defer to API working group because [#26134](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/26134) and [#26135](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/26135) are arguably breaking changes. If API WG determines these to be breaking changes we can’t backport and would need to be marked as breaking changes for `v12`.
* Set: 
  * [#25284](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/25284)
  * [#24937](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/24937)
  * [#26135](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/26135)
  * [#26134](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/26134)
