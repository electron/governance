## Backport Requests

**Nota Bene:** If you are the requester, you are generally expected to attend the meeting. If you are unable to do so, please state your reason for requesting the backport.
 
- Backport [fix: set nativeWindowOpen when sandboxed #18273](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/18273)
    * This changes behavior of window.open
        * Fixes an issue, but would break people working around it
        * We should make very clear in the release notes that people may need to correct their workarounds
        * **Verdict:** YES backport to `5-0-x` and `4-2-x` and release new patch versions
