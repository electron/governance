## Agenda

 *  Everyone should fill out [this form to help set the agenda](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOCd4eAi_pfNvyaoS0L8bFRkDIaJy2_H0SlJwRW3lHl9Q64g/viewform) of the [upcoming Electron Maintainers Summit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10xwcjdw--g4m_1O8WCnyGOCO8F4aNP5wnRYeUMARcVU/edit)
 *  Should we publish tags to both `e/e` _and_ the nightlies repo?
     *  **@ckerr** rightly mentioned that this can be confusing since it's not clear immediately where the executables are located
     *  **Verdict:** we should reference website for releases instead of GitHub 
* Thoughts on [#18981](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/18981)?
    * **Verdict:** Deprecate in 6, remove in 7

## Backport Requests

- [feat: add app.disablePluginSandbox(mimeType)](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/18939)
  - Requesting backport to 6-0-x
  - This mitigates the breaking change of enabling mixed sandbox by default on pepper plugins, which are now sandboxed as well, without being configurable
  - **Verdict:** Passing buck to upgrades

**Nota Bene:** If you are the requester, you are generally expected to attend the meeting. If you are unable to do so, please state your reason for requesting the backport.
 
## Action Items

* Update the documentation to reference the website for release types instead of the Releases tab
