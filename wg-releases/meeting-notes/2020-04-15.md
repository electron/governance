## Agenda

- (@alexeykuzmin) [#21256 Accessing `document.cookie` in preload script will break cookies after navigating to a new URL](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/21256)
    * This is a real regression and it affects Teams among other apps.
        * All `7.x.y` and `8.x.y` releases are affected.
    * This is an upstream issue with Chromium, for which there exist workarounds
    * **Verdict:** We will wait and confirm with Alexey before proceeding
* Issue triage schedule
    * Do we want to rotate issue triage to make sure it's done more reliably?
    * Let's take a roll call for who would be interested in performing issue triage on a semi-regular basis
        * Note: this does not mean necessarily solving, simply adding labels and perhaps determining if it's a reasonable issue for us to solve or closable based on lack of actionable outcomes.
* Spicy pepper schedule?
    * https://electronhq.slack.com/archives/CUWPAN8AX/p1586902566006000
    * **Verdict:** Tentatively schedule Electron v11 for quiet release.
