## Agenda

1. Backports
  * `feat: add process.getSystemVersion()` [#17141](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17141)
  * Discussion about what the policy for backporting `semver-minor` features to active beta cycles should be
    * Should there be a point during the beta cycle beyond which we no longer accept semver-minor?
      * **Resolved** No
      * Instead, the bar for accepting semver-minor backports should be that there's a good justification (as determined by the releases wg) 
        * The champion of a particular backport should expect to attend the WG meeting where it is being discussed in order to give that justification.
2. What's the goal for how long `master` -> `stable` should be?
  * Chrome is ~12 weeks, should we match that?
  * [Insitgating Issue Comment](https://github.com/electron/roller/pull/8#issuecomment-467996465)
  * Should we speed up releases?
    * How long should it be from master -> stable?
    * How long should it be between stable releases?
  * @ckerr and @codebytere mention that people seem to be happy with the 12-week cadence
    * If we change it, we should consult with AFP
    * Actually, the release time we care about is Chrome `stable` -> Electron stable, not Electron `master` -> Electron `stable`
    * General agreement that we should aim to match Chrome's release structure (canary / dev / beta / stable)
      * This would mean a fairly major change to our versioning structure

Suggestion: we should to move the start of this meeting earlier by 15 minutes, to give extra time in case of spillover
    - **Resolved** Yes

## Follow-Up Discussion

1. Should our release schedule match Chromium's?
2. `npm` module organization
    - `electron` vs `electron-nightly`
3. Process of adding new Releases WG members
