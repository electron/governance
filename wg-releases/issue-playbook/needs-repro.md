Please provide a standalone test that a tester could run to reproduce the issue. This makes fixing issues go more smoothly: not only does it ensure the right thing is tested, but it also prevents triage from bottlenecking on making testers write new tests for each new issue.

I'm setting the more-information-needed label for the above reasons. After you've responded, please @ me in a followup comment.

Thanks in advance! Your help is appreciated.
