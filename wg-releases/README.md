## Feature Backport Requests for Major Versions in Beta
With our 12-week major release cadence, we are _not_ considering feature backport requests after Week 3 of each beta cycle. Backport requests after Week 3 will only be considered if there is a very good reason. For backport requests please submit the link to the PR and reason for backport to the Releases WG agenda for consideration.
