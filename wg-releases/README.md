## Rules for Membership

1. Attend three consecutive meetings
2. Request entry into Releases Working Group by asking the current Chair
3. Entry request is voted on at a subsequent meeting, during a portion of the meeting which the requester shall not attend
4. Record outcome

## WG Removal Policy

If a sitting member of the WG has not been active in a meaningful way for at least one month, the WG may vote to remove them from its set of sitting members.

This is done primarily to ensure that there are no open avenues of compromise for the project given that the Releases WG confers notable permissions.

## Meeting Schedule

* **Sync Meeting** 45 min every Wednesday at [23:00 UTC](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=23%3A00+UTC&ia=answer)
* **Major Release Cadence Meeting** 1 hour every Thursday at [00:00AM UTC](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=00%3A00+UTC&ia=answer)

Meeting notes may be viewed in [meeting-notes](meeting-notes).

## Feature Backport Requests for Major Versions in Beta
With our 12-week major release cadence, we are _not_ considering feature backport requests after Week 3 of each beta cycle. Backport requests after Week 3 will only be considered if there is a very good reason. For backport requests please submit the link to the PR and reason for backport to the Releases WG agenda for consideration.
