## Agenda
* Contributor Training feedback
    * Keeley to send out today
* Thoughts on using Tweet together?
    * Tierney to set up a private repo for us
* Find outcomes of contributor training and post in channel:
    * Send up examples of new PRs submitted
        * https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/21897
        * https://github.com/electron/governance/pull/229
        * Electron Fiddle PRs
    * Postman and Dropbox joined QA working group
    * GitHub query for handles of all members who were there
    * One of the groups doesn't user GitHub; we may need to ask them directly.
* Hack Weeks: Are we still doing them? Can we invite contributor training members to them?
    * The issues for hack weeks are pretty hard, and space can be limited
    * Biggest challenge for training is getting space, and convincing people to spend time on it
    * We should do hack weeks again; just keep attendance low



## Followup
* Create search query for GitHub usernames (Tierney)
* Add GitHub handle question to survey (Keeley)
