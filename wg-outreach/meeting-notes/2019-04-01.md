## Agenda
* Onboarding project check-in
    * https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/17456 
    * run through of electron build for macOS (sofia), windows (JD), and linux (david)
        * Sofia on macOS: all told, took 5-6 hours including troubleshooting
        * Sofia's notes from building electron on MacOS: https://hackmd.io/Ef3mj2xXTBKR9grGsSZHog?both 
    * Mentorship
    * suggestion: Slack onboarding doc includes who to reach out to, which channels to join, and what to do when you're bored 

## Action Items
 - [ ] "Get Involved" link on top level README.md in https://github.com/electron/governance (@tonyganch)
 - [ ] in the top level README.md in https://github.com/electron/intern-guide add list of channels to use as resources, e.g. `#ask-anything` (@sofianguy)

 - [ ] Suggested changes for build instructions (@ckerr)
     - [ ] Tell users how much free disk space they'll need
         * debug takes about 30gb
         * chromium download takes about 12gb
     - [ ] At top of ["pull request doc"](https://electronjs.org/docs/development/pull-requests) maybe say this doc is for writing new PRs; if you just want to build Electron from scratch, see building-from-gn doc
     - [ ] Explain at the beginning of ["Cached builds (optional step)" ](https://electronjs.org/docs/development/build-instructions-gn#cached-builds-optional-step) why someone would want to include this step
     - [ ] In ["Getting the Code"](https://electronjs.org/docs/development/build-instructions-gn#getting-the-code) step, document a step of ensuring gclient is in path -- we can probably write in more detail about setting up gclient (depot_tools) under our GN prerequisites section of the doc on setting up the $PATH correctly
     - [ ] "To build, run ninja with the electron target: Nota Bene: This will also take a while and probably heat up your lap." suggest saying _how long_ it might take on some example hardware to give a frame of reference
     - [ ] In ["Building"](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/build-instructions-gn.md#building) maybe explain the difference between Debug and Release builds
     - [ ] suggestion: we could add explanation excerpts of what things like the gclient step is supposed to be doing – downloading chromium
     - [ ] suggestion: edit note that it will take a long time to build electron; longer than the downloading step – go eat dinner
     - [ ] screenshot during the downloading chromium step so that you know what it should look like when you’ve successfully started downloading. especially because we note that it will take a while; the user should know when to “go grab a coffee”
     - [ ] suggestion: we could do a screen shot of what it looks like when you’ve successfully started building, e.g., “[685/17661] CXX obj/components/keyed_service/core/core/simple_dependency_manager.o” from iterm
