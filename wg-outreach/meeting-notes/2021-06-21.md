## Agenda

### Reducing spam in the issue tracker

This topic has been brought up internally a few times, but we don't have a silver bullet solution yet.
We should bring this up as a topic of discussion at the next Maintainer Summit. One suggestion was to
have a bot to ask maintainers to triage issues in terms of levels of difficulty. Another one was to
redirect eager contributors to join our Discord server.

Note: We've renamed the `good first issue` tag to `beginner friendly`. In the future, we should also
mention whatever solution we come up with in CONTRIBUTING.md

### The future of Spectron

Spectron is our homegrown testing framework, but it has gone unmaintained for a long time. We should
first figure out what testing solutions app developers use, and make a decision on what to publicly
recommend from there.

Some solutions:
* Rewriting Spectron to stop using remote
* Other testing frameworks: Playwright, Webdriver.IO

### Twitter engagement

* New docs website
* Reminding people about Discord
* Keeleyâ€™s Global Maintainers Summit when the VOD goes live ( + Blog post)
