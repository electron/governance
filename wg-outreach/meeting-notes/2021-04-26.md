## Agenda

### Spam in `good-first-issue` label

In `electron/electron`, labels marked as good first issues often receive many
comments from inquiring contributors searching for projects to contribute to.
However, since issues touching the core code require a good amount of context,
C++ knowledge, and a working local Electron checkout, many commenters don't follow up.

Since the `good-first-issue` label encourages low-effort comments, we should do the
following:

* Re-label the `good-first-issue` label so that it's less searchable
* Document this label in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
* Add a Discord #contributing channel

### @Unverified members from Discord

When we transitioned away from the emoji react verification system, we marked
all unverified users as `@Unverified`. It's been a few months since then, and
there are still a couple hundred of them in the server.

Should we kick them? Yes.

### Global Maintainer Summit

@bnb is helping organize GitHub's [Global Maintainer Summit](https://globalmaintainersummit.github.com/).
As maintainers of a large open-source project, we have a bunch of things that
we could talk about (community management, automation using bots, etc.)

The CFP is due on May 1 (soon)!

### Website redesign work

@erickzhao and @molant have been working on a rewrite for the Electron website.
Work can be tracked at https://github.com/electron/electronjs.org-new.

Two things that we can start thinking about:
* Gaps in our documentation/guides
* Visual redesign
