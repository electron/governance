## Agenda
* Onboarding docs/process -- Now is a great time to refine Electron onboarding
    * build instructions:
        * [GN](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/build-instructions-gn.md)
        * [Linux](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/build-instructions-linux.md)
        * [macOS](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/build-instructions-macos.md)
        * [Windwos](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/build-instructions-windows.md)
    * Current onboarding process:
        * @ckerr - nightmare-ish because chromium's codebase is massive. No onboarding documentation.
        * Need someone to pair with to get started
    * [GitHub WIP intern guide](https://github.com/electron/intern-guide/)
        * A private repo but `wg-outreach` members have been added
        * This is an early WIP document for onboarding the GitHub Electron interns in June, but it could be revised to be a general-purpose onboarding doc
    * TODO items:
        * step 1: build electron
            * [ ] @sofianguy test macOS
            * [ ] @cruzerld test Linux
            * [ ] @jdalton test Windows
* https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/17429 
    * @ckerr will talk to @zeke about this issue
