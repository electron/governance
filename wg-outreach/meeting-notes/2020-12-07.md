# WG Outreach
Date: December 7, 2020

## Attendees
* @bnb
* @erickzhao
* @rromoff
* @sofianguy

## Agenda
* Discord update: Our server’s community is still growing at a steady pace. This is promising!
* Adobe Flash EOL messaging
  * Context: Adobe Flash is being removed from Chromium in January 2021. It’ll be completely removed altogether in Chromium 88+ (from Electron 12 onwards) and blocked as Out of Date from all prior versions of Chromium.
It’s currently unclear to us how this blocking policy will affect older versions of Electron.
  * Once we determine what’s going on about what’s happening to answer the possible questions, we should post on the blog about it (for searchability purposes).
* Electron app developer survey findings
  * Context: @molant has been working on collecting feedback regarding Electron from downstream app developers. The results have been collected into an internal report so far. We are looking into making the results public, but are unsure of the format so far.
  * Rachel will take a look this week and make recommendations.
* Administrative Housekeeping:
  * Next meeting is cancelled (we will reconvene after the new year on January 4).
  * It will be the end of Erick’s 4-month term as chair at the end of 2020.
