## Agenda
* BLM: Anything else we want to do for outreach?
    * Home page discussion
    * Let's switch back to the homepage, remove the greyscale, keep the banner up through end of June, and then turn off the banner around July 4th.
    * Having some issues with translation and glotbot
* Electron introduction: Anything we want to add here?
    * bit.ly/electron-openjs
* Update Twitter Account Email Address
    * Seems that it's unlikely we'll be able to get meaningful access to the current email address soon, should just change it and risk the API access request changing.

## Action Items
From this meeting:
* None

Previous:
* Tweet Season of Docs blog post next week (@erickzhao)
* Is SpaceX running Electron?!
    * See if we can find folks at SpaceX to confirm.
    * They're not :'(
