## Agenda

* Electron China usergroup?
  * A user named Black-Hole reached out to us about forming a user group in China. I’d like to invite him to an Outreach WG meeting to talk about what that could look like! Jacob and he have already spoken and he’s on board with this user joining a WG first and then proceeding from there.
* Discord update
  * Quiet period seemed to have gone smoothly.
  * Drastically reduced spam.
