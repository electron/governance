# Outreach WG

Date: February 18, 2020

## Attendees
**Members:**
- @ckerr
- @erickzhao
- @cruzerld
- @felixrieseberg

## Agenda
- Erick brought up the AtomIO Slack. The wg has felt for quite some time that Slack isn't exactly a great community tool, but it's not like we've told the community that they should go somewhere else. Topic for the summit?
- Felix is going to release a new version of Fiddle this week

## Followup
* Create search query for GitHub usernames (Tierney)
* Add GitHub handle question to survey (Keeley)
