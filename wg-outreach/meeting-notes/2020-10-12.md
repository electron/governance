## Agenda
* Hello Rachel!
  * Marketing Lead at the OpenJS Foundation.
  * Can help Electron with any big milestones or updates that we want to amplify.
  * What kind of help? Writing, brainstorming, retweeting, posting content, etc.
  * We have a lot of resources because we’re an impact project.
  * For Releases: Send information 2 weeks before things actually happen (the earlier the better). Questionnaire from Rachel?
  * Keeley: Will create a folder in Releases Drive so that Felix can drop Slack Electron/Node/Chromium recap content.
* Community Discord project: recap so far
  * 400+ members!
  * Help channels
    * Vlad working on installing help bot (similar to TypeScript server, except their bot crashes for us because we have fewer help channels)
    * We need to make sure people aren't necessarily expecting answers to every question from a maintainer
  * Rules: internationalize?
  * We’ve had a lot of Korean users join and not accept the rules. Maybe we should expand to listing the rules in other languages?
* Hacktoberfest project: recap so far
