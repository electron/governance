## History

The first governance proposal was made by Jacob Groundwater with [this slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12TyQQbE1oMJiLBCAvjuOmhoF2k5iQtzuUJG6Nx08Prs/edit#slide=id.p) and [presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dl0TiZEo636eWFUESO_Ewvse0D4Im10e/view?usp=sharing). See also [this overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Xm1uFHzmwjZFNjyiLynC86_0DVlp7VitHy8Qigdwdg/edit)).

When the working groups first met, they defined their own agendas and rules, which were recorded [here](https://hackmd.io/75EHutAhSTm1g4ex6KHoyQ).

A considerable part of the Feb 2019 Electron Developer's Summit was spent reaching consensus on governance. (TODO: Sofia's notes here)
