# Slack

## Owners

All members of the Administrative Working Group shall be granted the "Owner" role in Slack.

Certain members of the Infrastructure Working Group can be granted the "Owner" role in Slack.
Adding members of the Infrastructure Working Group as owners requires a vote from the Administrative Working Group.

Current infra owners are listed below:

| Name | Slack Handle | Date Granted |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| Shelley Vohr | @codebytere | 09-28-2022 |
| Samuel Attard | @marshallofsound | 09-28-2022 |

Slack requires a single Primary Owner, who will be selected by the Admin WG.
[Samuel Attard](https://github.com/marshallofsound) is the current Primary Owner of the ElectronHQ workspace.

## Admins

All members of the [Community & Safety Working Group](../../../wg-community-safety/README.md) have the
"Admin" role in Slack.

## Members

All [maintainers](../../../README.md#definitions) shall have a full-access Slack account on Electron HQ.
When offboarding from governance, emeritus maintainers shall have their Slack accounts converted into
Multi-Channel Guests.

## Guests

All Multi-Channel and Single-Channel Guests must fill out the [ElectronHQ Slack Maintainer Group form](https://electronjs.org/maintainers/join)
before gaining Slack access. Once this form is filled out, the [Community & Safety Working Group](../../../wg-community-safety/README.md)
will review the request. If the request is approved, the guest will be added to the applicable channel(s).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Adding guests to non-default channels**
>
> Before a Guest is added to a channel, a message must be posted to that channel stating the intent to
> add that guest to the channel after 24 hours and asking for concerns to be raised.
>
> Every channel member must have 24 hours to raise concerns about the guest being added to the
> channel regardless of timezone. After 24 hours without any concerns raised, the guest may be added
> to the channel.
>
> It must be announced in the channel that the guest was added to ensure that all current members are
> aware a new guest is now in that channel.
