# Slack

## Slack Owners / Admins

Slack requires a single Primary Owner, who will be selected by the Admin WG. [Samuel Attard](https://github.com/marshallofsound) is the current Primary Owner of the Slack Workspace.

Slack Owners / Admins are assigned as per the [Community & Safety Working Group Documentation](../../../wg-community-safety/slack-access.md)

## Full Users

All [maintainers](../../../charter/README.md#definitions) shall have a full-access Slack account on Electron HQ.

## Multi-Channel / Single-Channel Guests

In a variety of situations, some [collaborators](../../../charter/README.md#definitions) may be added as Guests to the Electron HQ Slack. The process for requesting guest access for a collaborator is detailed in the [Community & Safety Working Group Documentation](../../../wg-community-safety/slack-access.md).

* People attending Mini-Summits or Hackweeks should be added as single-channel guests to the related `event-*` channel.

Before a Guest is added to a channel it must be announced in that channel to ensure that all current members are aware a guest is now in that channel.  As only Slack Owners can invite guests it is their responsibility to ensure that all members of a given channel are OK with the addition of a guest.

## Private Slack Channels

Private channels are discouraged unless there is a clear need, e.g. for sensitive information such as discussion of vulnerability reports.

## Shared Slack Channels

For communicating with larger groups of [collaborators](../../../charter/README.md#definitions) from external companies sometimes it is more appropriate to create a single shared channel than it is to invite everyone individually as a guest.

All shared channels should be public and have to be approved by a Slack Owner before they can be linked.  If a shared private channel needs to be created, a reason should be provided when requesting the channel.
