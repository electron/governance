# GSuite

All full members of governance will receive a GSuite account for the `@electronjs.org` domain.  This account is _required_ to sign in to the services we use including Slack, GitHub, Heroku, AWS, Grafana, etc.

## Offboarding

If a governance member leaves their GSuite account will immediately be disabled, 30 days later the account will be permanently deleted to save GSuite costs. If during the 30 day window data needs to be recovered from an account, please reach out to the Infrastructure WG in Slack.
