## Rules for Membership

In order to join the Infrastructure Working Group, an aspiring member must:

1. Show a continued interest in the systems this group is responsible for
2. Be a long-trusted member of the maintainers community
3. TBD, this group is still forming primarily in an organizational capacity, when the initial storm is over this list will be updated with a more accurate set of requirements

## WG Removal Policy

If a sitting member of the WG has not been active in a meaningful way for at least one month, the WG may vote to remove them from its set of sitting members.  The vote must pass with a majority (>50% of sitting members excluding the subject of the vote).

This is done primarily to ensure that there are no open avenues of compromise for the project given that the Infrastructure WG confers notable permissions.
