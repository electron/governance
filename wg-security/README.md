## Rules for Membership

See [Membership and Notifications](membership-and-notifications.md)

## WG Removal Policy

If a sitting member of the WG has not been active in a meaningful way for at least one month, the WG may vote to remove them from its set of sitting members.

This is done primarily to ensure that there are no open avenues of compromise for the project given that the Security WG confers notable permissions.
