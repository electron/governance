## Current Objective and Key Results
**Objective:**

Electron is used/trusted by organizations with enterprise and corporate-high-security environments.

**Key Results:**
1. Increase adoption of Electron security best-practices & tooling in AFP and **partner applications**
2. Increase engagement of website security documentation (i.e. MOAR pageviews)
3. Increase **measurable security** for self-identified enterprise apps.

* _Partner Applications_: an app reporting feedback to Electron but outside the AFP
* _AFP_: App Feedback Program
* _measurable security_: an audit tool like https://github.com/doyensec/electronegativity, or self-report
