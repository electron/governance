# Docs and Tooling Working Group

Feb 14, 2019

## Discussion

* `asar` module
    * Has a dependency on `node-mksnapshot`, which lives in electron-archive, But this dependency has a vulnerable dependency (see: electron/asar#163)
    * Should we remove this feature?
        * Not documented, but shows up in `--help`
            * Not sure it will even work these days
        * Felix will remove this feature and push a new version
* Fiddle
    * Add a link to the Electron site linking to `/fiddle`
    * Do we replace the API Demos link with this?
        * Who maintains this? (Mostly Shelley and Michelle just keeping things up to date)
    * Michelle to open issue on the `electronjs.org` repo to discuss with website WG
* `electron-download`
    * Should probably support this in core?
    * Maybe something we'll talk about in the `userland` discussion at summit
        * What is the promotion process for a tool that has gotten so big/popular that it should be officially supported?
