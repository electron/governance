# Docs & Tools WG meeting 2019-05-09

## Attendees
 @Hashimoto
 @ckerr
 @killian
 
## Agenda

1. Unified Documentation 
    * Reiteration of goals from ckerr: have a single set of sample code that can be shared across website, Fiddle, and api-demos; make electronjs.org/docs more organized & navigatable, increase the number of code samples so that new users will know how to do anything in Electron
    * Launching code examples from docs into Fiddle (@ckerr)
    * What changes would we need to make to the docs in `electron/electron`? (@ckerr)

1. Making 'Breaking Changes' more discoverable
    * Kilian points out this is useful to link to in release notes
    * If we use the same terminology and link to this in every release notes post, developers will know to use that.

## Action Items

 * Open tracking issue for electronjs.org/docs page brainstorming & improvements (@ckerr)
 * Add link to 'Breaking Changes' in release notes script? Open issue & get feedback from Releases WG (@ckerr)
