# API Working Group

## Date: 2020-03-09

### Attendees 

* **@nornagon**
* **@zcbenz**
* **@jkleinsc**
* **@itsananderson**
* **@codebytere**
* **@MarshallOfSound**

### Followup

* Extensions API

### Agenda

* Properties - should we use getters and setters or functions?
  * **Verdict** - we will make both available to consumers for [primitive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive) properties.
  * Boolean primitives will have functions taking the form `setX` and `isX`, while other primitives will have functions taking the form `setX` and `getX`.
  * We will remove standing properties deprecations

* Open Spec Proposals
  * **Verdict:**
    * Open spec proposals block their implementations being merged
    * Proposals can be updated after merge so long as no significant semantics change
    * Proposals can be merged once they've been made sufficiently visible to stakeholders and have at least 2 reviews
  * We should make reviewing open proposals a standing agenda item.

## Action Items

- @codebytere to de-deprecate existing properties deprecations
- @zcbenz to update best practices API doc
