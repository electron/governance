    - not discussed

    * [feat: support dialog accessory view option on macOS](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/23692)
        * **Verdict:** needs formal spec & better overview of motivation.
        * are we going to support rich text? what about simpsons gifs?

        * **Verdict:** Approved
    * badging on nativeImage
