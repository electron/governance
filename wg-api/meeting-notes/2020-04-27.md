### Followup
* @zcbenz to [docs: views API: child views and layout engine] (https://github.com/electron/governance/pull/271) with "plan B"
    * not updated yet; followup again next meeting


### Agenda

1. [docs: add print API consistency proposal](https://github.com/electron/governance/pull/232)
    * **Verdict:** Approved
    * It's been approved, promisification backwards compat will be removed in v12
2. [docs: clipboard.getNativeFormat() and clipboard.writeBuffers()](https://github.com/electron/governance/pull/229)
    * Related - Raw Clipboard Access API (Fugu)
        * [Issue 897289: Raw Clipboard Access API](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=897289)
        * [Design Doc: Raw Clipboard Access](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XDOtTv8DtwTi4GaszwRFIJCOuzAEA4g9Tk0HrasQAdE/edit)
    * if we rely on the fugu api, we'd be restricted to fugu's restrictions (e.g. only accessible in renderer process, only while view is active)
    * native node module is an option, but chromium already has high quality apis for this
    * if/when we do our own clipboard apis, we should aim to match fugu apis as close as possible
    * is there urgency on this? the current spec is close to landable, should we land it without the fugu changes and treat that as a separate thing?
        * No, not urgent, it's ok to refactor.
    * [ACTION] @jkleinsc to play with the fugu api and report back

3. [API review requested PRs](https://github.com/electron/electron/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3Aapi-review-requested)
    * [ [WIP] feat: route frame based permission checks through our permission check handler](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/19903)
        * **Verdict:** No objections, let's go ahead.
        * Kind of a bugfix
    * [feat: add APIs for accessing NSUserDefaults in the given domain](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/22193)
        * inactive
    * [feat: add desktopCapturer.getWebContentsStream() to get media stream id from web contents](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/22701)
        * discussion ongoing
    * [feat: add support for optimizing simple objects and functions over the context bridge](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/22774)
        * pending perf tests
    * [feat: add new render-process-gone event](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/23096)
        * Should update doc to reflect it could be thrown from multiple WebContents
        * can we get the process id of the crashed process to detect dupes? => chromium doesn't give us that info, though maybe we could collect it somehow? for future work.
        * **Verdict:** Go ahead.

4. `crashReporter` API changes: [#23265](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/23265)
