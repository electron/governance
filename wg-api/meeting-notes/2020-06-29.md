### Agenda

1. [Flagging experimental features proposal](https://hackmd.io/xikoUxTDS7WMbQIo0ZkVeA?view)
    * Need something available before JS runs?
    * Combine with [fuse](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/24241) feature?
    * Is it wise to reuse Chromium's feature flag?
    * Could have `electron.features`?
    * Base feature has enable/disable by default and has override
    * Experimental flag is useful for upgrades
    * Features flag doesn't require patch
    * Would we want to use this for deprecations?
        * Not at this point, but maybe in the future
        * Possibly use for forward looking features (eg test new feature coming in v9 in v8)
            * eg. https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/24086
