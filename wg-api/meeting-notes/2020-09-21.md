### Agenda

* [API Review Requested PRS](https://github.com/electron/electron/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3A%22api-review%2Frequested+%F0%9F%97%B3%22+is%3Aopen+-label%3Aapi-review%2Freviewed+sort%3Acreated-asc):
   
  *   [[WIP] feat: Expose renderer spellcheck API](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/25060)
      *   No longer WIP
      *   There’s no Web API for this
      *   (Sam:) Not convinced this should be on webFrame
      *   [ACTION: Sam to discuss this. Where should this go?]
  *   [feat: add support for will-navigate and will-fail-load custom error pages](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/25128)
      *   Weird returnValue thing?
      *   Prevents white page.
      *   Where does the error code go?
          *   Netlog
          *   Devtools console
      *   event.failWith(...)?
      *   This doesn’t trigger for `fetch`
      *   Could we expose a NavigationThrottle API directly…?
      *   Should be marked as experimental, using the flag feature
  *   [feat: implement allowFileAccess loadExtension option](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/25198)
      *   This is ~= the “Allow access to file urls” in the extensions preferences in chrome
      *   Should we expose ExtensionPrefs? (For remembering whether allowFileAccess: true across reloads) Not for now.
      *   (SamM) Followup to previous responses in PR. Avoid ExtensionPrefs.
  *   [feat: add BrowserWindow.isTabletMode API](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/25209)
      *   Seems fine
  *   [feat: add serial api support](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/25237)
      *   We should make sure we expose the same surfaces that Chrome does in terms of UI
      *   When do the added/removed events start getting emitted…?
      *   Let’s not back ourselves into a hole w.r.t. WebUSB which uses similar APIs
      *   re-review
  *   [feat: [net] add "credentials" option to net.request](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/25284)
      *   Gives the ability to opt out of sending session auth.
      *   More closely matches fetch().
      *   :check:
  *   [feat: add macOS fast user switching evt](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/25321)
      *   Should this be on powerMonitor…?
      *   It’s next to lock-screen and unlock-screen
      *   Maybe we could have a new “system” module…? [for later followup]
      *   :check:
  *   [feat(extensions): expose ExtensionRegistryObserver events in Session](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/25385)
      *   Should this maybe be on session.extensions.on(...)?
          *   meh
      *   NB the pdf extension always emits the “ready” event
      *   :check:
  *   [feat: custom toast xml and failure reporting for notifications](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/25401)
      *   Can’t be called “error” because that would be a breaking change.
      *   :check:
  *   [feat: allow setting SSL config](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/25461)
      *   Should mention what the defaults are in the docs.
      *   :check:
  *   [[wip] feat: add webFrameMain API to the main process](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/25464)
      *   SamM: Figure out lifetime of WebFrame instances (lookup vs hold references).
      *   Finalize API in followup next meeting.
