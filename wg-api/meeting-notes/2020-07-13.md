### Agenda

* [feat: add visible-on-all-workspaces-changed event #24485](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/24485) 
    * **Motivation:** At present, there is not a way to detect when the "visibleOnAllWorkspaces" property changes from outside the app, which are possible by e.g. toggling from the macOS dock. A developer could attempt to poll for changes, but that's somewhat unwieldy when we could instead add an event to more effectively notify developers of changes to this window property.
    * Approved conceptually but the implementation needs improvement; @zcbenz to followup in PR
* [feat: add child-process-gone event to app #24367](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/24367) 
    * Approved
