### Followup

* Where did our previous discussions from the 2019-11-18 meeting land? Did anyone take notes?
  * Let's re-discuss the shortcuts proposal? [globalShortcuts => shortcuts](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/20964)
  * What's the motivation?
  * Is this technically feasible?
  * There's a 3rd-party module that does this, but poorly (electron-localshort)
    * [electron-localshortcut](https://github.com/parro-it/electron-localshortcut)

### Agenda

* [//extensions API](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/19447#issuecomment-514848721)â€” NB, none of this is available in any release, and won't be until //extensions is stable & working. But we should still talk about this draft API!
  * Consider pushing it to `session.extensions.loadExtension` / etc.
  * What happens if you load the same extension twice? Potentially w/ a different version?
  * Load extensions from ASAR?
  * What extensions should we test with?
