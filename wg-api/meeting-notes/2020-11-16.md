1. [PRs](https://github.com/electron/electron/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3A%22api-review%2Frequested+%F0%9F%97%B3%22+is%3Aopen+-label%3Aapi-review%2Freviewed+sort%3Acreated-asc)
    *   [feat: add powerMonitor.onBatteryPower](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/26494)
        * approved
2. Discussion - what PRs should be marked as [api-review/requested ðŸ—³](https://github.com/electron/electron/labels/api-review%2Frequested%20%F0%9F%97%B3)?
    *   Jeremy - suggests review by default
    *   Maybe have an automated bot to let folks know there are API reviews needed?
    *   Ad hoc approvals have happened and we should continue to do so
    *   This group should help reduce the number of breaking changes by making sure APIs are well designed
    *   Could we measure how we are doing in API design - eg measure number of breaking changes that were due to poor API design
    *   Decision - review APIs by default but reduce review time
3. Meeting time 
    *   miniak  - some meetings were at 1 AM Prague time
    *   Maybe alternate meeting times
4. New API WG chair
