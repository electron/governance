## Areas of Responsibility

* Define the process for which API changes are reviewed and approved.
* Create initiatives to develop/modify/change API implementations.
* Increase participation with web standards groups.

## Associated Repositories

* [`electron/electron`](https://github.com/electron/electron)
* [`electron/zoilist`](https://github.com/electron/zoilist)

## Meeting Schedule

* Biweekly Rotating Times:
  * 4 PM PT bi-weekly [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=N21qcmpibWdiZTgwYmFkb2dwanNsY2Zmb3BfMjAyMDA4MjRUMjMwMDAwWiBlbGVjdHJvbmpzLm9yZ19zbm1qMW4xMmYyNnRqZ3UyZm11NmY0Nm8zOEBn&tmsrc=electronjs.org_snmj1n12f26tjgu2fmu6f46o38%40group.calendar.google.com&scp=ALL)

Meeting notes may be viewed in [meeting-notes](meeting-notes).

## Joining the API WG

In order to become formal members of the WG, prospective members must:

1. be actively contributing to the work of the WG, and
1. be approved by a 2/3rds majority of current WG members (rounded up).
    1. The prospective member shall leave the meeting during the deliberation and vote.
    1. The meeting notes shall contain only the outcome of the vote (approved/not approved), not the individual votes.
    1. Members not able to attend the meeting at which the vote occurs may submit their vote to the Chair prior to the meeting.

If you're interested in joining the API Working Group, reach out to an [existing member](#Membership) and ask to be invited to the regular meeting and as a guest to the #wg-api channel in Slack.

### Actively contributing

"Actively contributing" doesn't necessarily mean writing code. It does mean that you should be in regular communication with the API WG (including attending meetings), and it does mean that you should be materially contributing to the project in some way. If you're not sure whether the work you're doing counts as "materially contributing", reach out to a [member](#Membership) and ask. 🙂
