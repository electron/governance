## Joining the API WG

In order to become formal members of the WG, prospective members must:

1. Be actively contributing to the work of the WG, and
1. Be approved by a 2/3rds majority of current WG members (rounded up). A meeting will be scheduled to commence voting.
    1. The prospective member shall leave the meeting during the deliberation and vote.
    1. The meeting notes shall contain only the outcome of the vote (approved/not approved), not the individual votes.
    1. If quorum is unable to be met, an asynchronous vote via Slack can be used as a substitute with the same approval rules.

If you're interested in joining the API Working Group, reach out to an [existing member](#membership) and ask to be invited as a guest to the #wg-api channel in Slack.

## WG Removal Policy

If a sitting member of the WG has not been active in a meaningful way for at least one month, the WG may vote to remove them from its set of sitting members.

This is done primarily to ensure that there are no open avenues of compromise for the project given that the API WG confers notable permissions.

### Actively contributing

"Actively contributing" doesn't necessarily mean writing code. It does mean that you should be in regular communication with the API WG, and it does mean that you should be materially contributing to the project in some way. If you're not sure whether the work you're doing counts as "materially contributing", reach out to a [member](#membership) and ask. 🙂
