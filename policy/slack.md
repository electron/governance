# ElectronHQ Slack Workspace

The people working on Electron organize their work using Slack, a "hub for teamwork". Even if you've worked with Slack before, it might be a good idea to review some of the guidelines about what's considered good etiquette in our workspace.

## Guidelines

### Reacji and "Post as Announcement"

You can "react" to messages with emoji. Apps and bots can, in turn, [perform operations in response to an emoji reaction](https://reacji-channeler.builtbyslack.com/). We in the Electron organization have a powerful emoji, the pineapple :pineapple:. Whenever you react to a message with a pineapple emoji, the message will be cross-posted to the #announcements channel.

### Mentions: `@here`, `@channel`, and `@everyone`

Slack allows users to ping everyone present in a channel using three groups: `@here` for all currently active members in a channel, `@channel` for everyone in a channel, and `@everyone` for literally everyone. While we haven't disabled those groups, _do not use them unless absolutely necessary_. Push notifications are the equivalent of texting someone, only use `@`-mentions with exactly the people you _need to reach_.

* Do not use **@everyone**.
* Do not use **@here** or **@channel** in channels with more than 10 users – and then only if you want to reach all those people.

### Channel Names

Slack uses channels to organize work into "chat rooms". You can read more about Slack channels and [how to use them here](https://slackhq.com/how-to-organize-your-work-life-into-slack-channels). In order to organize channels, we're using _prefixes_. We recommend that you consider using one when creating new channels:

* `announce-`: Announcement channels, not used for general chatter – and excellent for following along.
* `proj-`: Project-specific channels, like `proj-typescript` or `proj-newsletter`.
* `bot-`: Channels used by bots and apps, like `bot-twitter` or `bot-electron-repo`.
* `idea-`: A channel about a project that's not quite a project yet, but worthy of its own channel.
* `wg-`: Channels for governance working groups.
* `event-`: Channels for individual events.
* `app-`: Channels for specific apps, like `app-slack`.

As a general rule, we have channels for each major release line of `electron/electron` - as an example, `5-x-y`.

### Prefer Channels, Avoid Direct Messages

Keeping communication and decision-making processes allows future contributors to learn how, and why, decisions were made. Preserving context and allowing other contributors, both future and present, to catch up is one of the big benefits of using Slack. With that in mind, we heavily recommend that you use channels and avoid direct messages.
