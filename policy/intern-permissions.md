# Intern Permissions

**Electron Intern:** An intern working on behalf of any company represented in the Governance structure, whose internship primarily entails that they work on Electron itself.

## In Working Groups

Any interns working full time on the Electron project on behalf of a company already represented in a working group can be nominated as an observer for that Working Group.

This nomination does _not_ automatically grant them voting rights within the Working Group, and they would be observing in a capacity of a member should their nominating party be the current Chair of that Working Group.

Once their internship concludes, they are welcome to request to join the Working Group as an independent contributor.

## Permissions

As a Working Group observer that intern would be granted the access that that working group would grant but only for the duration of their internship and under the strict supervision of the nominating member.

This means they would be granted Full User access on Slack, and GitHub permissions in accordance with members of that Working Group. If their nominating party is the Chair, they would not be granted the extra permissions the Chair may have; only those of primary group members.

This access will be revoked at the end of their internship assuming they do not join a working group of their own volition.
