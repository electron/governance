# Intern Permissions

**Electron Intern:** An intern working on behalf of any company represented in the Governance structure, whose internship primarily entails that they work on Electron itself.

## In Working Groups

Any interns working on the Electron project on behalf of a company already represented in a Working Group can be nominated as an observer for that Working Group.

People acting as observers do not have voting rights in the Working Group.

Once their internship concludes, they are welcome to request to join the Working Group as an independent contributor.

## Permissions

As a Working Group observer that intern would be granted the access that membership in that Working Group grants but only for the duration of their internship and under the strict supervision of the nominating member.

This means they would be granted Full User access on Slack, and GitHub permissions in accordance with members of that Working Group. If their nominating party is the Chair, they would not be granted the extra permissions the Chair may have; only those of primary group members.

Observer-based access will be revoked at the end of a the Electron internship.
