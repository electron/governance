# Leaving Electron Governance

This documents the process of leaving Electron Governance. A contributor is no longer in Electron Governance if they are no longer a member of any Working Group.

## Offboarding Items

* Update README file for the Working Group.

* Submit a PR in [.permissions repo](https://github.com/electron/.permissions/). Merging this PR will automatically remove the contributor from:
    * The WG's team on GitHub
    * The WG's user group on Slack

* Request an admin of Electron's Slack (any member of Community & Safety WG) to change the contributor to a guest account.

* Message in #access-request that the contributor has left Electron Governance. The Google suite account needs to be mannually disabled, and 30 days later the account will be deleted. See [details on GSuite permissions](./permissions.md#gsuite).
