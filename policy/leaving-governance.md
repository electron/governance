# Leaving Electron Governance

This documents the process of leaving Electron Governance. A contributor is no longer in Electron Governance if they are no longer a member of any Working Group.

## Offboarding Items

* Update README file for the Working Group. Typically the current WG chair will submit this, but any member of the WG can submit.

* Submit a PR in [.permissions repo](https://github.com/electron/.permissions/). Typically the current WG chair will submit this, but any member of the WG can submit.
    * Merging this PR will automatically remove the contributor from:
        * The WG's team on GitHub
        * The WG's user group on Slack

* Request an admin of Electron's Slack to change the contributor to a guest account. Message in #wg-community-safety for this. Any member of Community & Safety WG is a Slack admin.

* Message in #access-request that the contributor has left Electron Governance. The Google suite account needs to be mannually disabled, and 30 days later the account will be deleted. See [details on GSuite permissions](./permissions.md#gsuite).
