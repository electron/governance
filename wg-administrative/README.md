# Administrative Working Group

The Administrative Working Group (AWG) oversees the entire governance and project.

AWG members should consist of folks who manage a substantial investment in the project.
To avoid the AWG becoming the _superpower_ group,
members should not participate in other technical working groups.
The initial group members consist of management from GitHub, Microsoft, and Slack whose teams contain full-time Electron contributors.

In order to have a balance of voices,
the group should also seek to add a representative from the rest of governance,
and a non-governance member who can represent the community at-large.

The AWG should not make individual technical decisions.
It is important that other working groups have autonomy and agency to fulfill their responsibilities.
