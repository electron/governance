# Administrative Working Group

The Administrative Working Group (AWG) oversees the entire governance and project.

AWG members should consist of folks who manage a substantial investment in the project.
To avoid the AWG becoming the _superpower_ group,
members should not chair other technical working groups.
The initial group members consist of management from Microsoft, and Slack whose teams contain full-time Electron contributors.

## Areas of Responsibility

The AWG aims to ensure the collective health of the maintainers and working groups, while offering support as necessary through means that may not fall on any existing working group, such as a mechanism for escalation.

_The AWG should not make individual technical decisions._

It is important that other working groups have autonomy and agency to fulfill their responsibilities.

### Open Roles

The AWG is open to welcoming new members. Please note that as a prerequisite, interested parties must manage a substantial investment in the project, including supporting teams that contain regular Electron contributors
