# OpenJS Initiative

> Oversees application to OpenJS

# Responsibilities, Authority, and Limits

1. This initiative is tasked to draft and submit the preliminary application to OpenJS.
2. This initiative may negotiate with OpenJS about implementation specifics and tradeoffs.
3. This initiative *does not* have final authority to move the project.
4. This initiative is tasked to bring the application and negotiation to a final agreement that will be voted on by all working groups.
5. Any member of the initiative may interact with members of the OpenJS Foundation directly.

# Consensus

The group must come to consensus before the final recommendation is made back to the Electron working groups.
We will strive for unanimous consensus, and failing that will look for majority plus chair.

# Removal

1. Individuals may voluntarily relinquish their membership.
2. If all other members vote to remove a member.
3. The chair can remove a member, but should provide an explanation to other members. (e.g. to alleviate a deadlock where we want to remove TWO inactive members)

# Addition

1. Individuals may be added by majority approval of existing members.
2. Members of this initiative are not necessarily members of governance.
