# Electron Governance

The Electron governance system is comprised of Working Groups that oversee different aspects of the Electron ecosystem, and an Administrative working group that functions to resolve conflicts between them.

## Working Groups

## Definitions

* A _maintainer_ is anyone who plays an active role in governance.
* A _collaborator_ is active in the community, but not in governance.
* A _participant_ is anyone who is a maintainer or collaborator.
* A _working group_ is a group of maintainers that is formed to take responsibility for certain aspects of the Electron project. Normally these groups will meet regularly but in some cases will only meet as required to fulfill their responsibilities.
* A [_chair_](#Leadership) leads a working group.

## Responsibilities

All Working Groups have these core responsibilities:

* They shall decide for themselves, and publicly post, their rules, e.g. how decisions are made, when meetings are held, and who may attend.
* They shall [select](#Leadership-Terms-and-Selection) a chair to [represent](#Leadership-Responsibilities) the group.
* They shall keep meeting notes, including agenda items, discussion points, and outcomes for everyone to review.
* They shall be collaborative and work [in good faith](#Core-Values) with other Working Groups.

See [policy/charter.md] for more information.
