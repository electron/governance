## Agenda

* (@alexeykuzmin) fix: Add support for the new Japanese Era (Reiwa) to ICU (4-1-x)
    - https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17833 - Merged :tada: 
* Access to Azure
    * Azure is used by our Window CI on Appveyor and we needed a change to one of our CI images, but John was the only one with access and was on vacation.
    * Azure account is a GitHub account used by other GitHubbers, so outside access is prohibited
    * John will show Shelley Azure access/how to upgrade VM images
    * Long term we should think about having accounts owned by Electron versus GitHub
* How are we going to make up the remaining 5 week deficit between Electron Stable and Chromium Stable
    - v6 is M75 which hits stable on June 4th and we have stable planned for July 18th
    - decision was made to use m76 for v6; release 6.0.0 stable on July 30th - same day as Chromium 76 stable release
