## Agenda

* Tracking Chromium ToT / Canary
    * ToT (Tip of Tree) = Master
    * Canary = Nightly~ish (unsure how far behind ToT it is)
    * We should never have a broken (CI) tree in electron from a chromium merge
    * Two possible ways of doing this:
        1. Track canary in master
        2. Track canary in a separate branch, merge to master as appropriate
            * this is similar to how node works
            * usually ~1 small change a day, sometimes more
    * [RESOLVED]: try out tracking canary in a separate branch once M74 is merged
* M74 status
    * windows & mac CI are good
    * Linux has some failures on power observer related things
    * network service is enabled by default in M74, but we disable it
        * we'll enable it as a followup
        * not especially urgent, the old code isn't going away yet
        * but it will! don't sleep on this upgrade
* Is Node 12 yet?
    * there's a branch against node v12.x
        * quite a lot of changes
        * no more builtin, now only internal
            * this is gonna be a good chunk of work for us
            * we'll need to refactor most of our bindings
    * https://github.com/nodejs/Release/issues/417
        * RCs 1 per week from March 23rd 2019
        * Release - ETA April 23rd 2019
    * consider releasing an older node w/ a newer v8 instead of node mainline
        * node-v8 has a newer v8
    * should we downgrade our version of node in 5-0-x?
* Windows on arm support
    * talked with ARM folks in London
    * they have Electron / M74 working on arm/windows???? :O
        * can they share that?
            * no
            * because it's all upstreamed already ðŸŽ‰
            * there's a remaining node-gyp issue
    * being discussed in #proj-win-on-arm
    * don't want to support until we can run CI
        * there exists no server-grade win/arm machine
        * initial path will be to use consumer-grade hw sitting in John's office (lol) JCI-in-JST
        * John is in the process of getting HW and wiring it up to azure devops

## Action Items

* Look into how Canary version numbers work (@nornagon)
* try out tracking canary in a separate branch once M74 is merged
    * @robo to write a design doc
* figure out what we should do re: internal / builtin bindings for embedders (@codebytere)
    * embedders use a "linked" binding
    * ... which isn't tested and might not work???
    * anna will join the #wg-upgrades channel
* @nornagon to fix linux failures on M74
