# Upgrades WG weekly meeting 2019-02-12

## Discussion

- M73 status
    - https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/16494
    - Possibly :+1: for merge to 5-0-x? https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/16876
    - green ci on all platforms
    - V8 crash on arm32, but upstream bug maybe?
        - clusterfuzz found some similar ones
    - ready to merge to master pending review
- Is there a Node (pre-)release we can switch 5-0-x to?
    - no
    - there's a v12.x branch in nodejs/node
        - what's v12.x-staging?
            - v12.x-staging is the development branch
            - v12.x is closer to "official"
            - we should build our "ToT" node off -staging if possible
            - but once there's a release tag, we should switch to that
        - we should update 5-0-x to current v12.x-staging & rebase our node patches etc.
