## Agenda

* Absentee members
    * @brenca
        * was active during Aug
        * OSR is disabled in head
            * can we maybe reuse some chrome headless stuff?
        * [ACTION] Remove due to absentee, can always apply to join again once actively involved in upgrades again
* How is the chromium upgrade going?
    * Roller bot got confused between versions
        * Maybe use date instead of versions?
            * Very hard :tm:
        * Keep an eye on it, if it doesn't roll in a while something may be broken
    * Network test failing on all platforms
    * disabled some tests to keep the roll going
        * @loc looking into desktop capturer tests failing on ci, passing locally
* How is the node upgrade going?
    * Fully up to date
    * All fine other than the whole "nightlies being broken" thing
* Slow chrome rolls :(
    * Roller bot stops rolling after 10 days of not-merge
    * Assumed it would be easier to merge if it stopped rolling
    * Since that change we're slowing down at rolling
    * [ACTION] We should revert that change
    * [ACTION] We should have a label to block rolls
* 8.0 nightlies failing
    * release builds only, CI is fine
    * looks like started dying around Oct 14
    * node 12.10 roll landed on that day
    * [ACTION] Will investigate in #wg-releases
* Vote on @loc joining upgrades
    * [ACTION] Approved, add to all the things
