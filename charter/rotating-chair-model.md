# Rotating Chair Model

The Rotating Chair Model is a model of a working group that uses a chosen leader to push forward the working group's goals. The chosen leader is regularly replaced with a new one, creating a "rotation" of leadership among the working group's members. This rotation promotes knowledge sharing and distribution of work duties among members.

## Working Group Responsibilities

A Working Group that uses the Rotating Chair Model has an additional core responsibility:
* They shall [select](#Chair-Terms-and-Selection) a rotating chair to [represent](#Chair-Responsibilities) the group.

## Chair Terms and Selection

Each Working Group shall be led by a Chair.

The Chair has a term that is written in the Working Group's own charter. By default, that term is four months.

A person is eligible to chair the Working Group if and only if they satisfy all conditions:
1. They wish to serve as chair.
2. They are a member of the Working Group.
3. They are not the chair of more than one other Working Group.
    * i.e. One person may chair a maximum of two Working Groups at a time
4. They have not been the chair of that Working Group more recently than any eligible member.
    * i.e. Only the eligible members that have least recently (or never) been the chair of that Working Group are able to be chosen.

If there is nobody willing or able to serve as chair, then the Administrative Working Group should be notified for assistance. The AWG can optionally choose to make a delegate from the AWG a temporary chair for the Working Group with the primary goal of reenabling the Working Group's ability to sustain its own chair rotation.

The group will make a reasonable effort to notify potential candidates that a new term is coming so that interested parties can declare their eligibility.

A chair is selected at random from the set of eligible candidates. The candidates and selection are to be documented and made public.

A chair's term does not need to begin at the same time as other working groups.

If a chair steps down, a new one is selected and a new term begins (i.e., interim chairs are not needed)

## Chair Responsibilities

Chairs have responsibilities to their parent Working Group: they ensure that their Working Group is carrying out its mission.

Chairs have responsibility to all participants in transparently reporting the group's activity.

Chairs also have the following regular duties within their Working Groups:
* Collect agenda items prior to each meeting to ensure a smooth and focused Working Group meeting.
* Ensure that the Working Group is notified of the agenda for the meeting in a timely manner advance of the meeting.
* Attend and lead each Working Group meeting.
    * If the chair is unable to attend a given meeting, they should appoint another member to lead the meeting in their stead.
* Ensure meeting notes are uploaded to the `governance` repo in the Working Group's respective sub-folder following each meeting.
* Check into persistent issues present on a given Working Group's repositories of responsibility (ex. bot failures)
* Ensure that the WG roster list is an accurate reflection of current member activity.

In addition to these responsibilities, a chair may have additional responsibilities specific to their Working Group.
