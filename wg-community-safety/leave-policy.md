# Leave Policy

Occasionally, Electron maintainers take a leave of absence from the project for personal or professional reasons. When this happens, it is important to reduce the risk to the project of compromised accounts with administrative permissions since those accounts may be unmonitored during the maintainer's leave of absence. This is not intended as a judgement on any individual member, simply a risk-mitigation strategy for the project as a whole. This policy outlines the responsibilities of the Community and Safety Working Group when notified of an Electron maintainer taking a leave of absence from the project for any reason.

Because leaves of absence may be for private, personal reasons, notification of the Community and Safety Working Group may be made by sending an email to the [Code of Conduct notification email address][coc-email]. All communications through this email address are to be kept confidential.
