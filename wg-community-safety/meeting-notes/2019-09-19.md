## 2019-09-19 meeting minutes

### Miscellaneous

* Document vetting process for new Working Group members
    * **Stakeholders:** @felix, @malept, @kilian
* Is there a potential harm in giving full member Slack access for all governance members, i.e. allowed via low barrier to entry through some WGs
    * Concerns about sensitive data being easily available to members of groups with low barriers to accepting new members
    * All WGs should bring their join policies in line with other WGs
    * Potential spying is one problem but free-riding is another problem
    * Transparency means viewing but not participating
    * Inclusion means wanting to participate
    * Safety
    * Inclusion > Safety > Transparency (Robotic laws style)
    * Increase latency between WG accepting and CampS ratification before official acceptance
    * Probationary period?
    * Certain governance channels can be joined without being a formal member
    * If all WGs standardize on "attend three (out of six consecutive) meetings and then WG votes on membership" and then C&S WG ratifies official governance membership, is that a sufficient "probationary" system?
    * Do we want to ask WGs to standardize on consistent attendance of three out of any six consecutive meetings?
    * C&S would like WGs to require ongoing active participation to maintain governance membership (in other words full Slack access and governance permissions), suggest standardizing on a minimum of :point_up: attendance + variation from the default is fine with reasons
    * Should we put :point_up: into the charter?
* Make OKRs -- tabled until next meeting
