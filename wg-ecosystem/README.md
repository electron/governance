## WG Removal Policy

If a sitting member of the WG has not been active in a meaningful way for at least one month, the WG may vote to remove them from its set of sitting members.

This is done primarily to ensure that there are no open avenues of compromise for the project given that the Ecosystem WG confers notable permissions.

## Node.js Upgrade Policy

As a general rule, npm packages under the purview of the Ecosystem WG will support Node.js versions as
long as possible, even after a version has reached its End-Of-Life (EOL) date.
If too much friction arises from the burden of maintaining EOL versions of Node.js (e.g. trouble upgrading
dependencies or CI issues), we will perform a blanket upgrade of supported Node.js versions for all our packages
to the latest LTS version. This upgrade process will be revisited annually.

As of July 2024, our current plan is to upgrade all packages to the earliest Node.js version where `require()`
of synchronous ESM graphs will be supported (see [nodejs/node#51977](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/51977) and [nodejs/node#53500](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/53500))
some point after that version reaches its LTS date ([see Node.js release schedule for more details](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases#release-schedule)).

## Meeting Schedule

**Sync Meeting** 1 hour every other Tuesday @ [17:00 UTC](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=17%3A00+UTC&ia=answer)

Meeting notes may be viewed in [meeting-notes](meeting-notes).

## Joining the Ecosystem WG

Prospective new members should reach out to an existing member to ask to be invited to the regular meetings and to be added as a Slack guest to #wg-ecosystem.
That person may be added to the working group by a 2/3rds vote of WG members at a WG meeting.
The prospective member should leave the meeting while the deliberation & vote is underway, and be informed only of the outcome of the vote (approved/not approved).
