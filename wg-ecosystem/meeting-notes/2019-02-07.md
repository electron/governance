# Website Working Group

Feb 7, 2019

## Discussion:

 * [Michelle] https://github.com/electron/electronjs.org/issues/912
    * Have about ~500 apps, currently showing ~24 on the homepage
    * Don't have great usage data (if that's even a good metric)
    * Any curated list is bound to be opinionated
        * Ideal solution handled by an algorithm, not a hand-curated lists
    * Idea: show a random list, but include some minimum number of contributor/donator/maintainer/AFP/etc apps in the list
        * What criteria do we use to include apps in this list?
    * Idea: fade apps out and new apps in their place randomly while on the homepage
 * Donors list only includes Open Collective folks, not companies that donate time/employees/etc. to the development of Electron (e.g. Slack)
    * Jacob: "I figure we’ll put up a governance page soon after summit. That could definitely include listing people’s member organizations."
