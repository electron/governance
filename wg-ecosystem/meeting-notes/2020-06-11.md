## Agenda

### Follow-up
- @malept: Prepare Electron Forge 6 stable with a note that Native Node Module support with Webpack is not fully supported.
    - **Progress being made, but this is longer-term. We'll stop pinging every meeting for this.**
- @erickzhao: Email Appzi to give feedback about their lack of preferences.
    - Fell through the cracks -- **doing this now**.
- @erickzhao: Try to figure out better if there's a better meeting time.
    - @kilian was open to alternating meeting times.
    - **Next meeting moved to 1 hour later**.
- @felixrieseberg: Look into making the Electron Fiddle experience for switching between major versions more user-friendly.
    - **Let's create an issue in the repository.**
- @malept: merge rights for `electron/windows-installer`?
  * example: [Dependabot dependency bump](https://github.com/electron/windows-installer/pull/309)
    * Result: **Ta-da, permissions are changed**. :tada: 

### New Items
* @HashimotoYT: What's should be done with disabled apps: delete or stay.
    * They're taking a lot of package weight. Can we remove these disabled apps from electron/apps? **We're okay with this.**
    * **We should modify @felixrieseberg's script to remove rather than disable old apps.**
* @HashimotoYT: Metrics for weight of the package
    * Need to contact @MarshallOfSound
* Move Forge docs into the `@electron-forge` org
  * **Done!**
