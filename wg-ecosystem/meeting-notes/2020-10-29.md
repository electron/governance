## Agenda

- @vhashimotoo stepping down from Electron governance.
  - Vlad is leaving his role in the working group and resigning as chair. He won't be available on Slack anymore,
  but will still be active on the Electron Discord server (and will still maintain his admin role there).
  - Work to hand over:
    - [electron-i18n#785](https://github.com/electron/i18n/pull/785): Support for the docs to handle multiple major versions of Electron.
    This PR works, but build times increase massively (from ~5 minutes to ~40 minutes). His suggested alter
    - [electronjs.org#4319](https://github.com/electron/electronjs.org/pull/4319): Migrating electronjs.org from Browserify to Webpack.
    This PR only builds the JS files, so work needs to be done to compile all of our SCSS.
    - [fiddle#516](https://github.com/electron/fiddle/pull/516): Migrating Fiddle's publishing config from `softprops/action-gh-release`
    to Electron Forge's builtins.
    - [electronjs.org#2361](https://github.com/electron/electronjs.org/pull/2361): Migrating stylesheets to @primer/css. This mega-PR was closed,
    but many other PRs have been opened to incrementally update the styles page-by-page.
- Deprecating http://github.com/electron/electron-api-demos
  - Initial actions: remove mentions from website, repo READMEs, and unpin from GitHub org.
  - Before deprecation: change to use `update-electron-app`.
  - Suggestion -- move to userland? Between this and simply archiving the repo, not sure. Let's discuss this at another point.
- @Toinane Slack access -- will need to handle this.
