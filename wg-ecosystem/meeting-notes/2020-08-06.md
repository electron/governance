## Agenda

### Follow-up

### New Items

- @erickzhao: New permanent meeting time (we're not alternating anymore)
  - calendar invite needs to be updated
      - Done!
- @erickzhao: Maintainer Summit OKR review
    - We need to present how our OKRs went since the last maintainer summit last September.
    - Increase views on https://electronjs.org/docs
        - Should be easy enough to get from the Google Analytics dashboard
    - Increase adoption of Electron-provided tooling
        - Forge vs Builder NPM installs
        - Grab stuff for the Grafana dashboard
- @malept: [electron/electron#24470](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/24470). This PR (using mmap on asar files) is a prerequisite for another change (loading asar files from a dylib/dll) that will require changes in multiple ecosystem repositories.
    - New feature: fuses. These are toggles at package time to control features that are protected by code-signing.
    - We're going need to adapt packages to handle this new feature.
    - Examples: electron/asar, electron/electron-packager, new modules might need to be updated as well.
    - Nothing needs to be done right away, since the feature has not yet been implemented.
