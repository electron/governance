## Agenda

### Follow-up
* Results of async votes from last week
    * [Admin WG membership change](https://github.com/electron/governance/pull/262): **Passed**
    * [Chair Rotation](https://github.com/electron/governance/pull/276): **Passed**
* Documenting TypeScript breaking changes ([Context](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/23054#discussion_r406394398))
    * **Conclusion**: @MarshallOfSound gave feedback to @zcbenz earlier over Slack. PR should be good after the changes.
* Appzi for electronjs.org feedback
    * [Appzi in action](https://github.com/electron/electronjs.org/pull/3852)
    * i18n: not available yet
    * GDPR: they apparently don't collect mandatory cookies?
    * **Conclusion**: Let's ship to English versions of the website.

### New Items
* Migrating `hubdown` to the `docs` org ([Context](https://github.com/electron/governance/issues/164)) (@zeke)
    * @zeke was not able to attend meeting, but his team at GitHub is still willing to push this forward.
    * We're okay with moving it over since it's not a direct or transitive dependency for electronjs.org.
    * Sticking point: we'd like whoever owns the project to use our CFA solution.
    * **Conclusion**: If the docs team at GitHub is good with CFA, we'll transfer `electron/hubdown` over.
* Key Results: should these longer-term goals need updating? (@erickzhao)
    * **Conclusion**: We've decided to come up with goals for the WG asynchronously, and discuss them next meeting.
<!--   * Increase adoption of Electron-provided tooling (@ckerr)
  * Increase views on /docs (@felix) -->
