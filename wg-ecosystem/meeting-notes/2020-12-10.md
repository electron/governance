# Ecosystem WG
Date: December 10, 2020

## Attendees
* @erickzhao
* @malept 
* @marshallofsound
* @toinane

## Agenda
* electron-userland/devtron maintainer query
  * Context: we have gotten a request from a user who has developed a proof-of-concept of a more modern Devtron.
  * The first step would be to ask them to open a PR with their changes that we would evaluate. If the changes are good, we could give them write permissions on the repository and let them maintain the package.
  * We would have to figure out NPM access for the external collaborator.
* Public output from App Developer survey
* Recap: website downtime last week was due to PR being merged.
  * TODO: Look into RAM usage of our Heroku deployment.
  * Note that replacing our site with an SSG is not entirely possible due to some dynamic things (https://electronjs.org/headers)
* Administrative note: cancelling next meeting. See you in 2021!
