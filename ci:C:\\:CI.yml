üíÅ The OpenShift Starter workflow will:
- Checkout your repository
- Perform a container image build
- Push the built image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- Log in to your OpenShift cluster
- Create an OpenShift app from the image and expose it to the internet
‚ÑπÔ∏è Configure your repository and the workflow with the following steps:
1. Have access to an OpenShift cluster. Refer to https://www.openshift.com/try
2. Create the OPENSHIFT_SERVER and OPENSHIFT_TOKEN repository secrets. Refer to:
- https://github.com/redhat-actions/oc-login#readme

Executive Summary
DBRS, Inc. (DBRS Morningstar) assigned provisional ratings to the SoFi Consumer Loan Program 2021-1
Trust (SCLP 2021-1) Class A Notes, Class B Notes, Class C Notes, and Class D Notes (together, the
Notes). SCLP 2021-1 represents the 22nd rated term asset-backed security (ABS) transaction sponsored
by SoFi Lending Corp. (SoFi) and collateralized by unsecured consumer loans. Overall, this is the 54th
rated term ABS transaction sponsored by SoFi, 32 of which have been collateralized by student loan
refinancing loans.
SoFi began making refinanced student loans in 2012, targeting creditworthy professionals, principally
from graduate schools and top-tier undergraduate schools. In 2014, SoFi began to originate mortgage
loans, and in 2015, it further expanded its product line to include consumer loans. SoFi determined that
it could offer its student loan customers additional types of financing due to this momentum and, in
general terms, a lack of lenders in the home equity market.
The company expanded its underwriting in the consumer loan portfolio to differentiate higher-quality
obligors through additional credit work and cash flow analysis. To this end, SoFi underwrites based on
an obligor‚Äôs ability to repay for all products, which includes evaluating an obligor‚Äôs credit bureau report
to ascertain the creditworthiness of the applicant, in addition to employment and income verifications.
These factors, in conjunction with others, are incorporated in SoFi‚Äôs free cash flow (FCF) and real excess
cash flow (REC) analysis, which measures a prospective borrower‚Äôs ability to repay the loan after basic
payments amounts are taken into account (i.e., taxes, housing, debt obligations) and helps to determine
a credit tier in SoFi‚Äôs proprietary risk scoring system. These tiers influence the pricing and loan amounts
for which borrowers qualify.

Executive Summary (continued)
Borrower profiles are slightly different for the consumer loan portfolio than the student loan refinancing
portfolio. Compared with the most recent student loan refinancing transaction issued by SoFi, SoFi
Professional Loan Program 2021-B (SoFi 2021-B), consumer loan obligors in the SCLP 2021-1 transaction
have slightly lower income ($164,808 for SCLP 2021-1 versus $167,252 for SoFi 2021-B) and slightly
lower credit scores (754 for SCLP 2021-1 versus 778 for SoFi 2021-B).
DBRS Morningstar used a proxy approach to supplement the SoFi data to determine cash flow modeling
assumptions for this transaction. The DBRS Morningstar weighted average default and net loss
assumptions are 5.81% and 5.52%, respectively.
SoFi uses a third-party servicer for its student loan refinancing and mortgage products, but it services
100% of its consumer loan portfolio. Approximately 88.9% (by count) of the consumer loan obligors pay
via Automated Clearing House (ACH), which minimizes SoFi‚Äôs cash processing efforts and increases
payment capture rates.
The Notes will be collateralized by a pool of fixed-rate unsecured consumer loans that fully amortize over
their set maturity terms. This is the fifth SCLP transaction to include two-year loans and the ninth SCLP
transaction to include four-year and six-year loans; prior transactions were comprised entirely of threeyear, five-year and seven-year loans. Prior to their issuance, these loans were owned by the sponsor, its
Page 3 of 23 SoFi Consumer Loan Program 2021-1 Trust | September 27, 2021
financing subsidiaries or investors who purchased the loans from the sponsor. The sponsor has secured
warehouse facilities from both large and regional commercial banks.
The structure includes a fully funded Reserve Account (0.50% of the initial aggregate principal amount
of the Notes), overcollateralization (7.00%) and subordination (as a percentage of the initial aggregate
principal amount of the Notes) in the form of the Class B Notes (5.68%), Class C Notes (6.92%) and Class
D Notes (6.97%). The Notes will bear interest based on fixed rates that will be determined at pricing.
Rating Rationale
The provisional ratings on the Notes are based upon a review by DBRS Morningstar of the following
considerations:
‚Ä¢ The transaction assumptions consider DBRS Morningstar‚Äôs baseline macroeconomic scenarios for rated
sovereign economies, available in its commentary Baseline Macroeconomic Scenarios For Rated
Sovereigns, published on September 8, 2021. These baseline macroeconomic scenarios replace DBRS
Morningstar‚Äôs moderate and adverse COVID-19 pandemic scenarios, which were first published in April
2020. The baseline macroeconomic scenarios reflect the view that, although COVID-19 remains a risk to
the outlook, uncertainty around the macroeconomic effects of the pandemic has gradually receded.
Current median forecasts considered in the baseline macroeconomic scenarios incorporate some risks
associated with further outbreaks, but remain fairly positive on recovery prospects given expectations of
continued fiscal and monetary policy support. The policy response to COVID-19 may nonetheless bring
other risks to the forefront in coming months and years.
‚Ä¢ DBRS Morningstar's projected losses include the assessment of the impact of the
coronavirus. The DBRS Morningstar CNL assumption is 5.52% based on the Cut-Off Date
pool composition.
‚Ä¢ DBRS Morningstar incorporated in its analysis a hardship deferment stress as a result of an
increase in utilization related to the impact of the coronavirus on borrowers. DBRS
Morningstar stressed hardship deferments to test liquidity risk early in the life of the
transaction‚Äôs cash flows.
‚Ä¢ The transaction‚Äôs form and sufficiency of available credit enhancement.
‚Ä¢ Subordination, overcollateralization, amounts held in the reserve account and excess spread
create credit enhancement levels that are commensurate with the proposed ratings.
‚Ä¢ Transaction cash flows are sufficient to repay investors under all AAA (sf), AA (sf), A (sf), and
BBB (sf) stress scenarios in accordance with the terms of the SCLP 2021-1 transaction
documents.
‚Ä¢ Structural features of the transaction that require the Notes to enter into full turbo principal amortization
if certain performance triggers are breached or if credit enhancement deteriorates.
‚Ä¢ The credit quality of the transaction‚Äôs underlying collateral pool.
‚Ä¢ The credit characteristics of the borrowers in the transaction‚Äôs collateral pool (specifically,
weighted average FICO score and FCF) are the strongest to date.
‚Ä¢ The experience, underwriting and origination capabilities of SoFi.
‚Ä¢ The ability of the Servicer to perform servicing and collections on the collateral pool and other required
activities.
‚Ä¢ The ability of Systems & Services Technologies, Inc. (SST) to perform duties as a Back-Up Servicer.
Page 4 of 23 SoFi Consumer Loan Program 2021-1 Trust | September 27, 2021
‚Ä¢ The legal structure and expected legal opinions that will address the true sale of the personal loans, the
non-consolidation of the trust and that the trust has a valid first-priority security interest in the assets,
and consistency with the DBRS Morningstar Legal Criteria for U.S. Structured Finance.
Considerations
Operating History
‚Ä¢ Founded in 2011, SoFi is a relatively new company. The company‚Äôs initial business line was student loan
refinancing; in late 2014/early 2015, it expanded its loan offerings to include consumer loans and
mortgage loans. The company does not service the student loan refinancing product or the mortgage
product. The company hired servicing staff and a team of collectors to service the consumer loan
portfolio. As the consumer loan portfolio has grown, SoFi has hired experienced servicing personnel and
collectors to manage this portfolio efficiently. SoFi could experience financial stress that could result in
its inability to perform certain duties or to fulfill repurchase obligations as a result of certain breaches of
representations and warranties. DBRS Morningstar notes the following mitigating factors:
‚Ä¢ DBRS Morningstar has performed an operational risk assessment of SoFi and believes the
company to be an acceptable consumer loan originator and servicer. SoFi has an
experienced management team, an adequate level of capital and sufficient balance sheet.
‚Ä¢ SoFi has elected to service these loans. Approximately 88.9% (by count) of the obligors pay
via ACH, so the servicing department is currently modestly staffed, except for the more
complicated special situations where obligors have either filed for bankruptcy or are in
charge-off status or leading up to charge-off.
‚Ä¢ SST was hired as a Back-Up Servicer in 2015. SST will act as Back-Up Servicer if SoFi (as
Servicer) fails to perform certain obligations or upon certain events of bankruptcy or
insolvency.
Availability of Historical Performance Data
‚Ä¢ DBRS Morningstar has sized expected loss assumptions based on proxy data because of SoFi‚Äôs limited
operational and performance history. DBRS Morningstar has limited performance data to determine its
expectations for the SCLP 2021-1 consumer loan pool.
‚Ä¢ Additionally, the company issues two-year, four-year, six-year and seven-year term loans (10.2%, 24.4%,
4.3% and 6.1% of the loans in the pool by current balance, respectively) to obligors. This makes a proxy
approach more challenging because of the lack of comparable term loan data. Further, there has yet to
be a recession for loans originated through SoFi‚Äôs consumer loan lending platform, and thus the
performance of this particular type of consumer loan in a stressed economic environment has yet to be
established.
‚Ä¢ The derivation of the SCLP 2021-1 expected case default rate and other key assumptions,
such as the timing of defaults, recoveries and prepayment speeds, was conducted by
analyzing industry data and historical performance from other consumer loan issuers in both
stressed and benign economic environments. DBRS Morningstar took into account historical
static pool default data and existing consumer loan securitization trust performance, as well
as performance data and statistics provided by SoFi with respect to its consumer loan
Page 5 of 23 SoFi Consumer Loan Program 2021-1 Trust | September 27, 2021
program and consumer loans from other lenders in the market. DBRS Morningstar considers
the data sets to be adequate to perform its rating analysis for the ratings assigned.
The updated expected case CNL assumptions due to the expected impact of the coronavirus pandemic
for the SCLP 2021-1 pool by term segments are as follows:
Loan Term CNL (%)
24 month 1.38
36 month 2.75
48 month 3.85
60 month 7.98
72 month 8.80
84 month 11.55
Quality of Borrowers
‚Ä¢ The SCLP 2021-1 pool contains a weighted average FICO score of 753. Additionally, the consumer loans
have a weighted average borrower income of $164,808 and a weighted average borrower monthly FCF
after expenses of $6,248.
‚Ä¢ Compared with the most recent student loan refinancing transaction issued by SoFi (SoFi 2021-B),
consumer loan obligors in this transaction have slightly lower income ($164,808 for SCLP 2021-1 versus
$167,252 for SoFi 2021-B) and slightly lower credit scores (754 for SCLP 2021-1 versus 778 for SoFi 2021-
B).
‚Ä¢ As of the Cut-Off Date, the SCLP 2021-1 pool includes 7,811 accounts. A large portion of the borrowers
(78.8% of the pool current balance) are homeowners.
Deal Trigger
A Turbo Trigger will be in effect on any Monthly Payment Date if either:

The Pool Balance as of the end of the related Collection Period is less than 10% of the Initial Pool
Balance, or;
The Cumulative Net Loss Rate as of the last date of any prior Collection Period has exceeded the
applicable Cumulative Net Loss Rate Trigger Amount set forth in Appendix A.
This Turbo Trigger is curable at certain dates. This structural trigger will cause a lockout of any
distributions to the Certificateholders, further enhancing the speed of paydown of the Notes if tripped.

Originator
SoFi Lending Corp. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Social Finance, Inc. SoFi was founded in 2011 by a
group of Stanford MBA alumni, based on the idea of taking advantage of certain inefficiencies within
the student loan market. Since its founding, SoFi‚Äôs primary focus has been a student loan refinancing
product targeting creditworthy professionals principally from graduate schools and top-tier
undergraduate schools. Since its inception, SoFi‚Äôs employee base has grown to over 2,300 professionals
(full-time equivalent) as of June 30, 2021, with backgrounds across the consumer financial services and
financial technology landscape. In 2014, SoFi began expanding into different asset categories within the
consumer lending space, including consumer loans and mortgages. SoFi has an experienced executive
management team with several years of consumer loan and finance experience. SoFi sources loans from
a variety of channels, including referrals, web, mail and corporate partners. Under the corporate
partnership program launched in the fall of 2013, SoFi works with companies to incent employees to
refinance education loans with, and obtain consumer loans from, SoFi. Income is verified on all loans
other than those with a certain credit score and balance below $40,000. Employment is verified in all
cases where an offer letter indicating a future start date is provided as proof of income and on a random
sample of all other applicants.
SoFi operates and maintains its own origination and underwriting platform for personal loans. Credit
underwriting is centrally managed out of SoFi‚Äôs headquarters in San Francisco, California, though the
majority of the credit underwriting is implemented from offices located in Healdsburg, California, and
Cottonwood Heights, Utah. SoFi possesses state licenses, as needed, in states where it conducts lending
activities.
SoFi maintains a proprietary underwriting and servicing platform, which is integrated with the
origination system. Documentation and verifications used to support the decision-making process
include credit bureau reports, employment verification and income verification. These will be used to
determine the amount and pricing for a loan. Credit underwriting is divided by levels of authority, with
limited exceptions requiring senior approval. Controls are in place to ensure loan processes are
completed. SoFi uses automatic declines in both the consumer loan and student loan refinancing
portfolios, which are more broadly applied in consumer loan underwriting. SoFi has refined its lending
approach, emphasizing underwriting based on a borrower‚Äôs ability to repay, which incorporates multiple
levels of analysis.
SoFi continues to invest in its control environment. To this end, the company has tripled its compliance
staff over the past 18 months and developed and implemented an enterprise compliance assurance
process. In December 2015, SoFi formally established an Internal Audit function with reporting directly
to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The Internal Audit group became fully operational in
2016 and completed their first annual review in 2017. While all audit results are reported to the Audit
Committee, SoFi management declined to share the results with DBRS Morningstar and indicated that
the company does not share internal audit results externally.

To resolve an open inquiry from a federal agency related to an issue with its advertising disclosure, SoFi
may agree to certain guidelines for future advertisements. Based on the information currently available,
SoFi will not be admitting any wrongdoing and will not be obligated to pay a monetary penalty.
Therefore, it is not expected that there will be a material adverse effect on either SoFi or the Holders of
the Notes.
Servicer
SoFi will be responsible for servicing, maintaining custody of, and making collections on the trust
personal loans. SoFi‚Äôs servicing system is integrated with its loan origination platform, allowing
customer service representatives to view the history of the customer relationship. SoFi operates its
servicing platform from its Healdsburg office as well as new locations recently opened in Utah and
Delaware.
The company regularly reviews staffing capacity and does not rely on outside servicing support. Once
funded loans are boarded onto SoFi‚Äôs proprietary servicing system, procedures are maintained that
govern verification and monitoring.
Borrowers are billed on a monthly basis on either of two billing cycles, and statements are delivered
prior to the payment due date. If a borrower enrolls in autopay after disbursement, an autopay discount
rate of 0.25% is applied, the loan is recapitalized and the monthly payment is reduced, which would be
available to the borrower while enrolled. A significant percentage (88.9% by count) of the consumer loan
borrowers pay via ACH.
Collections activities begin on the first day after the payment due date, with notes maintained for
collection activities. SoFi uses calls made by collection agents and written notices as part of its collection
practices. Calls are recorded and agent performance is tracked. Delinquencies are tracked on a daily
basis. Skip trace activities are conducted and include obtaining a valid address and telephone number.
SoFi offers four types of forbearance as workout options: unemployment forbearance, military
forbearance, natural disaster forbearance and admin forbearance. Payment holidays, re-aging or formal
repayment plans are not offered. Charge-offs occur during the month in which a loan becomes 120 days
delinquent. Third-party collection agencies and law firms are used for charged off debt collections.

In an effort to provide professional support to its borrowers and to improve servicing communication
with both challenged and performing customers, SoFi established a Career Services group to provide
borrowers assistance, at no charge, with professional networking, resume design, interview practice and
salary negotiation. Any SoFi obligor may choose to use career counseling, regardless of employment
status.
The core servicing system was developed on the same platform as the origination platform. The
borrower and loan information is integrated in the transition from origination to servicing. All sensitive
customer data is encrypted and access is limited. SoFi maintains measures to ensure business continuity
in the event of a significant business disruption by creating secure, encrypted back-ups of customer and
internal data on a regular basis.
SoFi benefits from having SST provide back-up servicing. SST was engaged as Back-Up Servicer in
September 2015 and is experienced in servicing receivables, having serviced loans and receivables with
an original balance of more than $28.0 billion. SST was founded in 1995 and provides primary servicing
for portfolio transfers, conduits and ABS, and back-up servicing to the ABS term and warehouse lending
markets. SST provides end-to-end loan servicing solutions for auto, RV, marine, motorcycle, powersport
and unsecured consumer loans, as well as credit cards and other consumer receivables. As of June 30,
2021, SST services 666,699 active accounts with an aggregate balance of approximately $5 billion. It
manages deficiency/charge-off placements on a contingency-fee basis through one or more service
providers.

SoFi underwriting procedures incorporate the results of an FCF and STP analysis for each obligor.
Approximately 54.7% of the pool consists of loans with a original balance of less than $50,000. DBRS
Morningstar analyzed the impact of the FCF and average income and compared those measures to the
aggregate pool above. On average, loans with original balances less than $50,000 had a weighted
average FCF of approximately 78.7% of the weighted average FCF for the entire pool, and loans with
original balances greater than or equal to $50,000 had a weighted average FCF of approximately 125.7%
of the weighted average FCF for the entire pool. Likewise, loans with original balances less than $50,000
had a lower weighted average income than that of the entire pool, while loans with original balances
greater than or equal to $50,000 had a higher weighted average income than that of the
entire pool.

Page 18 of 23 SoFi Consumer Loan Program 2021-1 Trust | September 27, 2021
Events of Default
The transaction will include standard events of default, which contain cure periods and call for
acceleration of the principal balance of the Notes. Events of default include the following:
Default in the due and punctual payment of any interest on any Class A Note and such default
continues for two Business Days.
If no Class A Notes are outstanding, default in the due and punctual payment of any interest on
any Class B Note and such default continues for two Business Days.
If no Class A Notes or Class B Notes are outstanding, default in the due and punctual payment of
any interest on any Class C Note and such default continues for two Business Days.
If no Class A Notes, Class B Notes or Class C Notes are outstanding, default in the due and
punctual payment of any interest on any Class D Note and such default continues for two Business
Days.
Default in the due and punctual payment of the principal of any Note on the Final Maturity Date.
Default in the performance of any of the Issuer‚Äôs obligations with respect to the transmittal of
moneys to be credited to the Distribution Account under the provisions of the Indenture, and such
default shall have continued for a period of ten days.
Default in the performance or observance of any other of the covenants, agreements or conditions
on the part of the Issuer, the Administration Agreement, or the Securities, or any representation or
warranty made by the Issuer, the Administration Agreement, or the Underlying Trust Agreement
shall prove to have been false in any material respect when made, and such default shall have
continued for a period of 60 days after written notice.
Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Issuer.
If the only Event of Default is that specified in clause (7) above, then the Indenture Trustee shall not
incur Extraordinary Expenses in excess of $150,000 in connection with such Event of Default unless the
Holders of the Notes have agreed to pay such Extraordinary
Expenses as provided in the Indenture.
Credit Enhancement
Credit enhancement will consist of the Reserve Account, overcollateralization and subordination.
Outstanding Balance ($) Balance (%) Credit Enhancement (%)
Class A Notes 187,000,000 74.80 25.67
Class B Notes 13,200,000 5.28 20.37
Class C Notes 16,100,000 6.44 13.95
Class D Notes 16,200,000 6.48 7.47
Total Note Balance 232,500,000 93.00
Overcollateralization 17,500,650 7.00
Reserve Account* 1,162,500 0.50
Reserve Account is calculated as a percentage of the initial Note balance at the Closing Date.
‚Ä¢ Reserve Account Requirement means an amount equal to $1,162,500. This amount is fully funded and
non-declining.
‚Ä¢ Initial Overcollateralization will be 7.00% of the Initial Pool Balance at the Closing Date.
Page 19 of 23 SoFi Consumer Loan Program 2021-1 Trust | September 27, 2021
‚Ä¢ Specified Overcollateralization Amount will be equal to the greater of $2,500,006 or 10.50% of the
current Pool Balance. A Turbo Trigger is included in the structure. A Turbo Trigger will be in effect if
either: the Pool Balance is less than 10% of the Initial Pool Balance or the Cumulative Net Loss Rate has
exceeded the applicable Cumulative Net Loss Rate Trigger Amount set forth in Appendix A. This Turbo
Trigger is curable at certain dates. This structural trigger will cause a lockout of any distributions to the
Certificateholders, further enhancing the speed of paydown of the Notes if tripped.
Cash Flow Analysis
DBRS Morningstar incorporates a stressed cash flow analysis in its rating process. In the cash flow
modeling analysis, several inputs were stressed in order to test whether the transaction cash flows
could withstand potential performance and liquidity deterioration of the collateral at the requested
rating levels of AAA (sf), AA (sf), A (sf), and BBB (sf). Different assumptions were made for each term
bucket (two, three, four, five, six, and seven years), including different loss timing curves and different
prepayment curves. Also incorporated in this transaction is a hardship deferment stress because of the
increased utilization by borrowers related to the effects of the coronavirus. Hardship deferment
utilization stresses were formulated based on the DBRS Morningstar evaluation of industry-specific data,
which were adjusted to reflect the Sponsor‚Äôs experience and deferment policies, and the proposed
ratings. DBRS Morningstar stressed deferments to test liquidity risk early in the life of the transaction‚Äôs
cash flows.
DBRS Morningstar developed separate expected case default curves for each term bucket based on
SoFi‚Äôs historical performance as well as proxy data from peers in the consumer loan space. Four loss
timing curves were modeled for each term bucket to assess the sensitivity of the transaction structure to
the timing of defaults, including a front-loaded scenario, a middle-loaded scenario, a back-loaded
scenario and an evenly spread scenario. The timing of defaults reflects the potential for various
economic conditions and applies a high level of stress on the transaction‚Äôs cash flows to test the
resilience of the Notes.
In addition to the loss timing curves, three prepayment curves were modeled for each term bucket to
assess the sensitivity of the transaction structure to the timing of prepayments. While faster-thanexpected prepayments may lower the credit risk of the transaction because the securitization trust is
exposed to a shorter period of default risk, at the same time, faster prepayments may lower the amount
of excess spread generated by the underlying collateral, thus reducing the amount of credit
enhancement available to absorb losses. The updated expected case CNL assumptions due to the
expected impact of the coronavirus pandemic for the SCLP 2021-1 pool by term segments are as follows:
Loan Term CNL (%)
24 month 1.38
36 month 2.75
48 month 3.85
60 month 7.98
72 month 8.80
84 month 11.55
Page 20 of 23 SoFi Consumer Loan Program 2021-1 Trust | September 27, 2021
Break-even cash flow stress analysis demonstrated the maximized cumulative defaults (until the first
dollar of Note defaults) while keeping all other AAA (sf) AA (sf), A (sf), and BBB (sf) assumptions the
same. Based upon the most constraining cash flow scenario, the SCLP 2021-1 transaction is able to
withstand cumulative defaults of approximately 35.46% for AAA (sf), 30.95% for AA (sf), 24.84% for A
(sf), and 17.25% for BBB (sf). This represents multiples of approximately 6.43 times (x) for AAA (sf), 5.61x
for AA (sf), 4.50x for A (sf), and 3.13x for BBB (sf) of the DBRS Morningstar expected case cumulative
default rate expectation for the SCLP 2021-1 pool.
Please refer to Appendix A for additional cash flow assumption details.
Legal Structure and Opinions
SCLP 2021-1 is a special-purpose entity structured to be bankruptcy remote by restricting the Issuer‚Äôs
operations so that it does not engage in business with, or incur liabilities to, any other entity which may
bring bankruptcy proceedings against the Issuer.
DBRS Morningstar expects to receive an opinion of counsel to the effect that the transfer of the loans to
the trust constitutes a true sale and that the trust assets will not be consolidated with those of SoFi in
the event of bankruptcy. Additionally, DBRS Morningstar expects to receive an opinion of counsel that
the trustee has a first-perfected security interest in the trust assets.
DBRS Morningstar expects to receive an opinion of counsel to the effect that the Notes will be treated
as debt for federal income tax purposes rather than as an interest in the loans and other assets of the
trust, or as an equity interest in the Issuer.
The Issuer intends to treat this transaction as a financing, reflecting the Notes as its indebtedness for
tax and financial accounting purposes.
In addition, the SCLP 2021-1 transaction structure, representations and warranties, as well as
documentation, were reviewed for consistency with the DBRS Morningstar Legal Criteria for U.S.
Structured Finance.
