Thank you for your contribution to Electron!

We've noticed there hasn't been any activity from the author in some time, and since the pull request was opened, there have been many changes to the codebase. As a result, your pull request may no longer be applicable or could conflict with more recent updates.

To keep pull requests relevant for maintainers, we'll be closing this one for now. However, if you believe it's still relevant or if there was a mistake, feel free to request us to reopen it or provide a follow-up comment.

If you'd like to continue with your contribution, please update your branch with the latest changes from `main` and resolve any conflicts.
