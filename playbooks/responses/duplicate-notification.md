Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

We noticed that this is a duplicate of {{Issue URL}}. You may want to subscribe there for updates.

Because we treat our issues list as [the project team's backlog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Product_backlog), we close duplicates to focus our work and not have to touch the same chunk of code for the same reason multiple times. This is also why we may mark something as duplicate that isn't an exact duplicate but is closely related.

For information on how to use GitHub's search feature to find out if something is a duplicate before filing, see [the CONTRIBUTING guide](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
