Open source is largely volunteer-driven and collaborative. Because of this, time and energy to get things done are often the scarcest resources. We want Electron to be the best that it can be, but we also have to be realistic about what the team maintaining Electron can achieve. This means that:

* We may not give you an ETA for when an issue will get investigated or fixed
* We may decide that we aren't going to implement something you want implemented
* We may decide that we aren't going to accept a change that you want merged
* Insisting on or making demands for any of the above is considered against [the Electron Code of Conduct](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
