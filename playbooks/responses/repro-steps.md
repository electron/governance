Thanks for contributing!

All new issues now require steps to reproduce (also called "repro steps") the problem or the behavior you wish to see. We do this so we can be certain that we are understanding what it is you're describing and don't prematurely close the issue or implement the wrong feature. If you need help writing detailed repro steps, please see [the CONTRTIBUTING guide](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
