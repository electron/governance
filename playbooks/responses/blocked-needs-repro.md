## If No Repro Included

Thanks for reporting this and helping to make Electron better!

Would it be possible for you to make a standalone testcase with only the code necessary to reproduce the issue? For example, [Electron Fiddle](https://www.electronjs.org/fiddle) is a great tool for making small test cases and makes it easy to publish your test case to a [gist](https://gist.github.com) that Electron maintainers can use.

Stand-alone test cases make fixing issues go more smoothly: it ensure everyone's looking at the same issue, it removes all unnecessary variables from the equation, and it can also provide the basis for automated regression tests.

I'm adding the `blocked/need-repro` label for this reason. After you make a test case, please link to it in a followup comment.

Thanks in advance! Your help is appreciated.



## If Repro Requires Third-Party Tooling

Thanks for reporting this and helping to make Electron better!

Because of time constraints, triaging code with third-party dependencies is usually not feasible for a small team like Electron's.
