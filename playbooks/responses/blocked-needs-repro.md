## If No Repro Included

Thank you for taking the time to report this issue and helping to make Electron better.

Would it be possible for you to fork [electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start) to make a stand-alone app that reproduces this issue?

Stand-alone test cases make fixing issues go more smoothly: it ensure everyone's looking at the same issue, it removes all unnecessary variables from the equation, and it can also provide the basis for automated regression tests.

I'm adding the `blocked/needs-repro` label for this reason. After you make a test case (a [gist](https://gist.github.com) is preferred since gists can be loaded directly into [Electron Fiddle](https://www.electronjs.org/fiddle) for testing), please link to it in a followup comment.

Thanks in advance! Your help is appreciated.

## If Repro Requires Third-Party Tooling

Thank you for taking the time to report this issue and helping to make Electron better.

Researching issues that depend on third-party code is usually not feasible for the Electron team due to the time that would be required to research reported issues with open-ended dependencies.

Would it be possible for you to fork [electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start) for a small app that reproduces the issue by itself without other code?

Stand-alone test cases make fixing issues go more smoothly: it ensure everyone's looking at the same issue, it removes all unnecessary variables from the equation, and it can also provide the basis for automated regression tests.
