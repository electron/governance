Thank you for taking the time to report this issue and helping to make Electron better.

Would it be possible for you to fork [electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start) for a small app that reproduces the issue by itself?

Standalone test cases make fixing issues go more smoothly: it ensure everyone's looking at the same issue, it removes all unneccessary variables from the equation, and it can also provide the basis for automated regression tests.

I'm adding the `blocked/needs-repro` label for this reason. After you've responded, please link to the test case and @ me in a followup comment.

Thanks in advance! Your help is appreciated.
