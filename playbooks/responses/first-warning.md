Thanks for helping to make Electron better and especially the detailed bug report. You've made it very clear that this issue being fixed is important to you. 

Open source is tricky, and I understand that relying heavily on a project like Electron can be scary, frustrating, and confusing. We do not want to break anyone's apps. None of the maintainers want that. We even [run a program](https://electronjs.org/blog/app-feedback-program) to help ensure we fix participating apps' major issues during our beta cycle.

However, because of the Electron maintainers' limited time and resources, we can't get to everything immediately and some things we can't get to for an extended period. This is common in open source projects. Repeatedly commenting with no new information is not something we do here.

Moving forward, I would recommend reading and following the advice in [Creators, contributors, and collaborators](https://github.community/t5/Studies-in-Community/Creators-contributors-and-collaborators/ba-p/234).

Just to be clear, you are welcome to continue participating in the following ways:

1. submitting new bug reports with enough detail to reproduce - ideally a [Fiddle](https://electronjs.org/fiddle) example
1. a new feature request with context
1. logistical questions that may not be covered in the docs (e.g. asking about release timelines in a polite way)

Responding repeatedly with requests of the maintainer team are off-topic and will result in those issues being closed immediately.

_Please follow the next step exactly_

Let's all take a moment to digest the above. **Please do not interact with the project for 24-hours.** No comments, new issues, or pull-requests. After that, please look through your open issues and edit them to ensure they're entirely on-topic, and we can continue the discussion here about the best way to engage going forward.
