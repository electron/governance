Thanks for reaching out!

We have passed along the information to the maintainers team. Because we treat our issues list as [the team's backlog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Product_backlog), we close feedback issues after passing along the information to the maintainers to keep our backlog clean and focused. In the future, if you want to send feedback to the maintainers you can do so more directly by sending email to support@github.com.
