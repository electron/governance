Thank you for taking the time to report this issue and helping to make Electron better.

This issue has been marked for closing because this series of Electron has reached end-of-life and is no longer supported.

If you're still experiencing this issue in the latest version of Electron and would like this issue to remain open, please add a comment specifying the version you're testing with and any other information that a maintainer needs to know to reproduce the issue.

I'm setting the `blocked/need-info` label for the above reasons.

Thanks in advance! Your help is appreciated.
