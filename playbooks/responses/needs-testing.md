Thanks for your submission!

We require automated tests for all pull requests that include new or changed code. We do this so that we can ensure that we don't accidentally break your shiny new code the next time we or some other contributor submits a change. If you need help writing automated tests, check out {{the community forum and/or documentation}}. There are a bunch of helpful community members that should be willing to point you in the right direction.
