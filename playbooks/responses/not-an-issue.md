Thanks for reaching out!

https://github.com/electron/electron/issues is used for tracking feature requests
and bug reports, so you will probably find better luck with this question at one
of the links at https://github.com/electron/electron#community -- in particular,
be sure to give https://discord.com/invite/electron a try.

Good luck! I hope this helps!
