Thank you for taking the time to report this issue and helping to make
Electron better.

We are sorry that we do not always have the capacity to look at all reported
issues in a timely manner. There have been many changes in Electron since
this issue was reported and it may have been fixed in that time.

The version of Electron this issue was reported on, {{VERSION}},
has been superseded by newer releases -- the latest in that series is {{NEWER}}.
{{In addition, there are newer branches that supersede that series.}}
It would help us greatly if you could test this issue with the latest version.

I'm setting the `more-information-needed` label for the above reasons.
After you've responded, please @ me in a followup comment.

Thanks in advance! Your help is appreciated.
