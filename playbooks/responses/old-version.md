Thank you for taking the time to report this issue and helping to make Electron better.

The version of Electron you reported this on has been superseded by newer releases -- the latest in that series is {{NEWER}}.
{{In addition, there are newer branches that supersede that series.}}

If you're still experiencing this issue in the latest version of Electron, please add a comment specifying the version you're testing with and any other new information that a maintainer trying to reproduce the issue should know.

I'm setting the `blocked/need-info` label for the above reasons.

Thanks in advance! Your help is appreciated.
