## Warnings

For first offenses, the process is:

1. Take a screenshot of the offending content (the entire comment box)
1. Send the screenshot to @lee-dohm for his record keeping
1. Enter the violation text shown below being certain to at-mention the correct offender
1. Post the comment
1. Delete the entire comment containing the offending content

Violation text:

```markdown
[[at-mention]] your comment was deleted as a violation of the {{project code of conduct link}} as it
[[was insulting or derogatory/contained sexualized content/is considered harassment/published others'
personal information/is unprofessional conduct]]. You may consider this an official warning.
```

## More than warnings

For successive offenses:

1. Take a screenshot of the offending content (the entire comment box)
1. Note down the offender's handle
1. Send the screenshot to @lee-dohm for his record keeping
1. Let @lee-dohm know that this is not the first offense

@lee-dohm will then add the person to the banned user list for all GitHub open source projects.
