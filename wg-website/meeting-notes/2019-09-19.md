## Discussion

 * Is there a better way to handle Dependabot PRs?
     * The question: https://electronhq.slack.com/archives/C43E13N0J/p1566340618039600
     * One option: automatically merge semver minor,patch green items
     * One option: have dependabot push everything green & minor/patch into a single PR for easier human approval

 * Docs doesn't contain `Notification` [API page](https://electronhq.slack.com/archives/C43E13N0J/p1565640016036000)
     * We should file a bug for this issue and triage it async
     * Felix thinks he knows the problem and will take ownership of this

 * [VH] Phantom blocked required checks and deprecating old HCL syntax
     * https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+archived%3Afalse+sort%3Aupdated-desc+assignee%3AHashimotoYT+org%3Aelectron+actions
     * needs re-review from @MarshallOfSound, who has it marked as Changes requested
     * https://github.com/electron/electron-api-historian/issues/10
     * change required checks from old phantom Actions to new

 * Merge with Docs & Tools WG?
     * Question raised at last week's maintainers summit
