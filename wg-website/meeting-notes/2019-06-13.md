# Website Working Group

June 13, 2019

## Attendees

 - Michelle
 - Hashimoto

## Discussion

- [Michelle] Where should this new website/GitHub Actions documentation live?
    - Currently some old docs in `github/electron`, not accessible to non-Hubbers
        - Michelle to move into a `docs/` folder in the `electron/electronjs.org`
- [Michelle] How long should we wait to make sure Actions are doing us good before we ask GitHub to delete the Heroku apps formerly associated with the `i18n`, `apps`, and `releases` repos?
	- (H) Actions Most Wanted Feature, send job log into Slack when something goes wrong, eg `after_failure` job on Travis
        - This is a feature the Actions team will be working on
    - Going to leave it for a couple more weeks and discuss at the next meeting.
- [Vlad] Town name? Chernobyl
	- Blog post localization (?)
        - Idea: pull down the blog posts the same way we pull down `locale.yml` and include translated blog posts in the `i18n` repo
	- algolia-indices
		- Create an index for repos that depend on Electron [algolia/#6](https://github.com/electron/algolia-indices/issues/6)
            - `dependant-repos` currently not updating, but Shelley is working on a GitHub Action to keep it up-to-date
		- dock-related methods are missing from the index [algolia/#16](https://github.com/electron/algolia-indices/issues/16)
