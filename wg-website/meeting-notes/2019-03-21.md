# Website Working Group

Mar 21, 2019

## Discussion:

- [Michelle] [Feature apps by more objective criteria](https://github.com/electron/electronjs.org/issues/912)
    - Ideas for criteria that can help identify high quality apps:
        - On supported versions of Electron
            - Easy to crawl for open source, harder for closed source
        - Auto-update
        - Participate in the App Feedback Program
    - Feature high-profile apps, where high-profile comes to a vote
        - How to justify a "no" to a dev looking to get an app on the homepage?
    - Rotation
        - Keeps us from having to "choose"
        - Doesn't matter as much if an app isn't so high quality because it'l be rotated out next refresh/period/etc.
    - 50/50 split - hand-curate a small list of high quality apps (e.g. cool apps, AFP apps, etc), and mix it with a randomized set of apps
    - Have two lists - one small one of _company_ logos (showing coroprate trust), and later a list of featured apps (e.g. randomized, etc)
        - Proposal accepted by vote, to be implemented [Michelle]
- [Michelle] [It's difficult to find where to report security issues](https://github.com/electron/electronjs.org/issues/2171)
    - Governance page now exists; does this resolve, or does it need more work?
        - Add security link to site footer [Felix]
        - Update security link on Community page to link to security document [Michelle/Felix]
